"news, local-news, Ken little, fruit and vegetable, port macquarie, business

Straight-talking. Big-hearted. Decent. Those are some of the words used by others to describe Ken Little. He is best known for owning a long-standing fruit and vegetable store in Port Macquarie. But he is also widely respected for the huge amount of community work he does. Recently he was named our senior citizen of the year. But how much do you really know about him? What formed him and what makes him tick? Ken Little grew up on a farm at Ben Lomond near Glen Innes. He was the youngest child of 13. When he was born his father Benjamin was 67-years-old, his mother Ada only 38. His father had been left a widow with eight children with a farm to manage when his first wife died of cancer in the early 1940s. Ken's mother (who had two children of her own) was hired to work on the farm, manage the house and look after the younger children. Before long the two had fallen in love and had three more children, Jan, Benjamin and little Kenny. It was a simple childhood. On the farm he learnt the value of hard work. ""From an early age before I went to school I would milk the cows, ride or walk 5km to school,"" he recalls. ""Then after school I would round the cows up and separate the calves from their mothers so there would be milk for the next day. I also herded sheep."" The family moved to Port Macquarie when Mr Little was 10. He attended Port Primary School and Port Macquarie High School. By his own admission he was an ""average student"". But what he lacked academically he made up with other skills. ""I was always really active and independent, I played a lot of sport, fished a lot, played football,"" he said. The family didn't have a lot of money. His parents were on the old age pension. ""All the money I got I had earned from the time I was eight or nine,"" Mr Little said. ""My parents never gave me anything because they couldn't afford to."" When he was not playing sport or surfing he spent his weekends picking fruit to earn money. Towards the end of school he also began to notice girls. Mr Little met his wife Judy at the Kempsey showground when he was only 17. ""I liked her straight away, she smiled a lot, we got on,"" he said. He acknowledges it was easier to meet a partner back then but they were fortunate to find each other. When he left school he headed for Sydney like most young people. He had hoped to be a property evaluator but it didn't work out. He didn't like the city and missed the beach too much. Before long he was back in Port Macquarie, working in the fruit and veg department at Woolworths. Ironically, it was with one of his main competitors that his passion for the trade started. He set up Ken Little's Fruit and Veg in 1983. The small business originally run out of the Colonial Arcade. Disaster struck when Port Central was built. The road closures in Hay Street, loss of parking and heavy vehicle use in the area proved disastrous. ""We lost 85 per cent of our trade in a year,"" he said. ""I was stunned and devastated. I wondered if I could keep the business going and rebuild."" The business almost went bust and Judy went back to nursing to keep the family afloat. Difficult decisions were made but eventually they moved the business to Munster Street in 1996. The business started thriving but then in 2007 disaster hit again when a deliberately lit fire ripped through the store. ""Again I was thinking can I rebuild?"" he said. ""After lots of soul searching we decided to keep the business going for ourselves as we had put so much into it over the years, our staff and loyal customers,"" he said. ""We were able to gradually build the business up again and pay our bills."" The business now employs 45 staff and focuses on ""giving customers what they want"". His marriage to Judy has sustained him during difficult times. ""Like any marriage we have our ups and downs,"" he said. ""But we enjoy each other's company and we end up working things out. ""Sometimes you just need time and patience. We are different in a lot of ways, she is very artistic, and I love to watch and play sport. We don't try and change each other and the differences work."" He is proud but humble about his children's achievements. All have followed their passions. Eldest son Nigel holds a PhD in history and works for the Office of National Intelligence in Canberra. His second son Daniel is a talented former photographer. He is Ken's right hand man in the store. Daughter Naomi has travelled the world and currently lives in Denmark with her daughter working in marketing and design for an IT company. ""Do you know what the cloud is?"" he asks The Port News quizzically. Life can be difficult so how has Ken Little survived with such a sunny attitude? ""I've had a good life,"" he said. ""I try to enjoy all the simple things in life, I feel as though I live in paradise, I don't take anything or anyone for granted."" He holds fast to some principles his father taught him: ""Do unto others as you do unto yourself and if you have nothing nice to say about someone say nothing."" He is involved in a range of sporting and community groups, he has been a mentor, coach, fundraiser. What advice does he give the many young people he encounters? ""Try and stay positive,"" he said. ""When you fall down pick yourself up, remember every problem has a solution no matter how bad it is. ""Be a doer not a gonna, there are a lot of people in this world who make a loud noise that they are going to do this and going to do that but do nothing."" The Port News series is called In My Life.

"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

"Apple has today released Swift Playgrounds for the Mac. This marks the first time the app has made the jump from iPad to Apple’s desktop platform.

The app is based on its iPad counterpart and is built using Catalyst. That doesn’t mean that users should expect the app to look and feel like a straight port, though. Apple says that there is plenty in there to make sure this is a real Mac app.

Swift Playgrounds for Mac is a truly native macOS app with great performance, built using the powerful Mac Catalyst technology in macOS Catalina. This brings many of the same features users love from Swift Playgrounds on iPad, to the Mac. In addition, the Mac app adds unique features and user experiences that take advantage of diverse screen sizes and physical keyboard.

The app itself offers the same proposition as the Mac version. People won’t need any coding knowledge in order to try working with Swift Playgrounds, with the app walking them through some simple tasks and guides as they learn.

Swift Playgrounds is a revolutionary app for Mac and iPad that makes it fun to learn and experiment with code. You solve interactive puzzles in the guided “Learn to Code” lessons to master the basics of coding, or experiment with a wide range of challenges that let you explore many unique coding experiences. Swift Playgrounds requires no coding knowledge, so it’s perfect for students just starting out, from twelve to one-hundred-and-twelve. The whole time you are learning Swift, a powerful programming language created by Apple and used by professionals to build many of today’s most popular apps. Code you write works seamlessly as you move between Mac and iPad.

Swift Playgrounds has been hugely popular on the iPad and people have been using it to learn how to code, just as Apple had intended. The arrival of a Mac version opens up additional possibilities for those wanting to learn. Not least for those who simply don’t have an iPad to install Swift Playgrounds onto.

You can download Swift Playgrounds now, for free, from the Mac App Store. You’ll need macOS Catalina 10.15.3 to run it.

"news, local-news, Ken little, fruit and vegetable, port macquarie, business

Straight-talking. Big-hearted. Decent. Those are some of the words used by others to describe Ken Little. He is best known for owning a long-standing fruit and vegetable store in Port Macquarie. But he is also widely respected for the huge amount of community work he does. Recently he was named our senior citizen of the year. But how much do you really know about him? What formed him and what makes him tick? Ken Little grew up on a farm at Ben Lomond near Glen Innes. He was the youngest child of 13. When he was born his father Benjamin was 67-years-old, his mother Ada only 38. His father had been left a widow with eight children with a farm to manage when his first wife died of cancer in the early 1940s. Ken's mother (who had two children of her own) was hired to work on the farm, manage the house and look after the younger children. Before long the two had fallen in love and had three more children, Jan, Benjamin and little Kenny. It was a simple childhood. On the farm he learnt the value of hard work. ""From an early age before I went to school I would milk the cows, ride or walk 5km to school,"" he recalls. ""Then after school I would round the cows up and separate the calves from their mothers so there would be milk for the next day. I also herded sheep."" The family moved to Port Macquarie when Mr Little was 10. He attended Port Primary School and Port Macquarie High School. By his own admission he was an ""average student"". But what he lacked academically he made up with other skills. ""I was always really active and independent, I played a lot of sport, fished a lot, played football,"" he said. The family didn't have a lot of money. His parents were on the old age pension. ""All the money I got I had earned from the time I was eight or nine,"" Mr Little said. ""My parents never gave me anything because they couldn't afford to."" When he was not playing sport or surfing he spent his weekends picking fruit to earn money. Towards the end of school he also began to notice girls. Mr Little met his wife Judy at the Kempsey showground when he was only 17. ""I liked her straight away, she smiled a lot, we got on,"" he said. He acknowledges it was easier to meet a partner back then but they were fortunate to find each other. When he left school he headed for Sydney like most young people. He had hoped to be a property evaluator but it didn't work out. He didn't like the city and missed the beach too much. Before long he was back in Port Macquarie, working in the fruit and veg department at Woolworths. Ironically, it was with one of his main competitors that his passion for the trade started. He set up Ken Little's Fruit and Veg in 1983. The small business originally run out of the Colonial Arcade. Disaster struck when Port Central was built. The road closures in Hay Street, loss of parking and heavy vehicle use in the area proved disastrous. ""We lost 85 per cent of our trade in a year,"" he said. ""I was stunned and devastated. I wondered if I could keep the business going and rebuild."" The business almost went bust and Judy went back to nursing to keep the family afloat. Difficult decisions were made but eventually they moved the business to Munster Street in 1996. The business started thriving but then in 2007 disaster hit again when a deliberately lit fire ripped through the store. ""Again I was thinking can I rebuild?"" he said. ""After lots of soul searching we decided to keep the business going for ourselves as we had put so much into it over the years, our staff and loyal customers,"" he said. ""We were able to gradually build the business up again and pay our bills."" The business now employs 45 staff and focuses on ""giving customers what they want"". His marriage to Judy has sustained him during difficult times. ""Like any marriage we have our ups and downs,"" he said. ""But we enjoy each other's company and we end up working things out. ""Sometimes you just need time and patience. We are different in a lot of ways, she is very artistic, and I love to watch and play sport. We don't try and change each other and the differences work."" He is proud but humble about his children's achievements. All have followed their passions. Eldest son Nigel holds a PhD in history and works for the Office of National Intelligence in Canberra. His second son Daniel is a talented former photographer. He is Ken's right hand man in the store. Daughter Naomi has travelled the world and currently lives in Denmark with her daughter working in marketing and design for an IT company. ""Do you know what the cloud is?"" he asks The Port News quizzically. Life can be difficult so how has Ken Little survived with such a sunny attitude? ""I've had a good life,"" he said. ""I try to enjoy all the simple things in life, I feel as though I live in paradise, I don't take anything or anyone for granted."" He holds fast to some principles his father taught him: ""Do unto others as you do unto yourself and if you have nothing nice to say about someone say nothing."" He is involved in a range of sporting and community groups, he has been a mentor, coach, fundraiser. What advice does he give the many young people he encounters? ""Try and stay positive,"" he said. ""When you fall down pick yourself up, remember every problem has a solution no matter how bad it is. ""Be a doer not a gonna, there are a lot of people in this world who make a loud noise that they are going to do this and going to do that but do nothing."" The Port News series is called In My Life.

umm the california was a cargo ship i dont care what the article says .,"news, local-news, Ken little, fruit and vegetable, port macquarie, business

Straight-talking. Big-hearted. Decent. Those are some of the words used by others to describe Ken Little. He is best known for owning a long-standing fruit and vegetable store in Port Macquarie. But he is also widely respected for the huge amount of community work he does. Recently he was named our senior citizen of the year. But how much do you really know about him? What formed him and what makes him tick? Ken Little grew up on a farm at Ben Lomond near Glen Innes. He was the youngest child of 13. When he was born his father Benjamin was 67-years-old, his mother Ada only 38. His father had been left a widow with eight children with a farm to manage when his first wife died of cancer in the early 1940s. Ken's mother (who had two children of her own) was hired to work on the farm, manage the house and look after the younger children. Before long the two had fallen in love and had three more children, Jan, Benjamin and little Kenny. It was a simple childhood. On the farm he learnt the value of hard work. ""From an early age before I went to school I would milk the cows, ride or walk 5km to school,"" he recalls. ""Then after school I would round the cows up and separate the calves from their mothers so there would be milk for the next day. I also herded sheep."" The family moved to Port Macquarie when Mr Little was 10. He attended Port Primary School and Port Macquarie High School. By his own admission he was an ""average student"". But what he lacked academically he made up with other skills. ""I was always really active and independent, I played a lot of sport, fished a lot, played football,"" he said. The family didn't have a lot of money. His parents were on the old age pension. ""All the money I got I had earned from the time I was eight or nine,"" Mr Little said. ""My parents never gave me anything because they couldn't afford to."" When he was not playing sport or surfing he spent his weekends picking fruit to earn money. Towards the end of school he also began to notice girls. Mr Little met his wife Judy at the Kempsey showground when he was only 17. ""I liked her straight away, she smiled a lot, we got on,"" he said. He acknowledges it was easier to meet a partner back then but they were fortunate to find each other. When he left school he headed for Sydney like most young people. He had hoped to be a property evaluator but it didn't work out. He didn't like the city and missed the beach too much. Before long he was back in Port Macquarie, working in the fruit and veg department at Woolworths. Ironically, it was with one of his main competitors that his passion for the trade started. He set up Ken Little's Fruit and Veg in 1983. The small business originally run out of the Colonial Arcade. Disaster struck when Port Central was built. The road closures in Hay Street, loss of parking and heavy vehicle use in the area proved disastrous. ""We lost 85 per cent of our trade in a year,"" he said. ""I was stunned and devastated. I wondered if I could keep the business going and rebuild."" The business almost went bust and Judy went back to nursing to keep the family afloat. Difficult decisions were made but eventually they moved the business to Munster Street in 1996. The business started thriving but then in 2007 disaster hit again when a deliberately lit fire ripped through the store. ""Again I was thinking can I rebuild?"" he said. ""After lots of soul searching we decided to keep the business going for ourselves as we had put so much into it over the years, our staff and loyal customers,"" he said. ""We were able to gradually build the business up again and pay our bills."" The business now employs 45 staff and focuses on ""giving customers what they want"". His marriage to Judy has sustained him during difficult times. ""Like any marriage we have our ups and downs,"" he said. ""But we enjoy each other's company and we end up working things out. ""Sometimes you just need time and patience. We are different in a lot of ways, she is very artistic, and I love to watch and play sport. We don't try and change each other and the differences work."" He is proud but humble about his children's achievements. All have followed their passions. Eldest son Nigel holds a PhD in history and works for the Office of National Intelligence in Canberra. His second son Daniel is a talented former photographer. He is Ken's right hand man in the store. Daughter Naomi has travelled the world and currently lives in Denmark with her daughter working in marketing and design for an IT company. ""Do you know what the cloud is?"" he asks The Port News quizzically. Life can be difficult so how has Ken Little survived with such a sunny attitude? ""I've had a good life,"" he said. ""I try to enjoy all the simple things in life, I feel as though I live in paradise, I don't take anything or anyone for granted."" He holds fast to some principles his father taught him: ""Do unto others as you do unto yourself and if you have nothing nice to say about someone say nothing."" He is involved in a range of sporting and community groups, he has been a mentor, coach, fundraiser. What advice does he give the many young people he encounters? ""Try and stay positive,"" he said. ""When you fall down pick yourself up, remember every problem has a solution no matter how bad it is. ""Be a doer not a gonna, there are a lot of people in this world who make a loud noise that they are going to do this and going to do that but do nothing."" The Port News series is called In My Life.

I have joined a club that is bigger than it should be and is certainly one that I definitely do not want to belong to. On Christmas Eve, my beautiful friend Sheila Green was murdered by her brother who suffered from psychosis. So now, I am one of the approximately 40% of Americans who know someone who was killed with a gun. That is an obscenely high number and is probably a low estimate as that study was done in 2015.

My wife, Sheryl, and I, met Sheila through mutual friends and through Sheryl’s work, when we first moved to Madison in 1985, as Sheila was an ultrasound tech at the same hospital where Sheryl did her medical residency. It was easy to become friends with Sheila as she had an ever present smile that always made you feel good when you saw her.

Sheila was also a chocolate aficionado, purchasing only the finest chocolates and baking up scrumptious chocolate treats on a regular basis. She was kind enough to share her flourless chocolate torte recipe with my wife, who has made countless of them over the years, and we think of Sheila every time we eat one. Sadly now, we will fondly remember her with each future torte.

Sheila came from a large family, and she was close with her many siblings. She did her best to care for her troubled brother. Sheila knew he owned a gun, and in fact, he had a concealed carry permit. She insisted that he not bring it to her home. For reasons we may never know, her brother did not honor that request on Christmas eve, and brought his gun to her home and shot and killed her.

Sheila’s friends and family are all grieving now for such a needless loss. It is especially needless because there are extreme risk protection laws in 17 states also known as red flag laws which are specifically designed to prevent murders by people who are known to be dangerous. These laws authorize courts to issue a protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others.

Usually, the request for the order will come from relatives or friends concerned about a loved one who owns one or more guns and has expressed suicidal thoughts or discussed shooting people. Wisconsin, however, is not one of those states. Yet, it could easily have had this law in place in time to protect Sheila from her brother, who was a known danger who legally possessed a gun.

This past October, Gov. Tony Evers called a special legislative session to consider two common sense gun control measures: universal background checks and red flag legislation. Despite the fact that 80% of Wisconsin residents support passage of these laws, Republican legislative leaders refused to vote on, or even debate these popular measures.

In an utter act of contempt for voters, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald dismissed the Senate in 30 seconds and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos dismissed the Assembly in 15 seconds. Gov. Evers has considered calling another special session on these measures, but thus far, has not done so.

One would like to believe that as society grows and learns, it improves. Yet, when it comes to gun control, the United States continues to behave as if there is nothing we can do to prevent gun violence, leaving our nation stuck in a warped 21st Century Wild, Wild West.

This is my tenth gun control post on my blog in seven years, and while sometimes I feel like giving up, I persist, because too many innocent lives are being snuffed out on a daily basis. Sadly, this time, she was a friend.

I grew up during the Vietnam War, and every Friday on the evening news, the anchorman would report the weekly body count of dead and wounded. My mother shared some wisdom with me at that time, that applies to every single gun death. She said that she wished that they did not publish the number of dead, because that made them anonymous and allowed people to forget that each life lost was a real human being with friends and family.

The same is true with America’s out of control gun violence. I will not add the gruesome statistics to this post because I want every reader to read Sheila Green’s name, look at her beautiful smiling face, that will smile no more — and then call or e-mail Robin Vos and Scott Fitzgerald and demand that they find some courage to pass a red flag law.

It is too late for Sheila, but it is not too late for the many lives who could be saved in the future.

I sincerely hope that the loss of Sheila’s life will gain some purpose if the Wisconsin legislature passes a red flag law. We could even call it Sheila’s Law.

I have joined a club that is bigger than it should be and is certainly one that I definitely do not want to belong to. On Christmas Eve, my beautiful friend Sheila Green was murdered by her brother who suffered from psychosis. So now, I am one of the approximately 40% of Americans who know someone who was killed with a gun. That is an obscenely high number and is probably a low estimate as that study was done in 2015.

My wife, Sheryl, and I, met Sheila through mutual friends and through Sheryl’s work, when we first moved to Madison in 1985, as Sheila was an ultrasound tech at the same hospital where Sheryl did her medical residency. It was easy to become friends with Sheila as she had an ever present smile that always made you feel good when you saw her.

Sheila was also a chocolate aficionado, purchasing only the finest chocolates and baking up scrumptious chocolate treats on a regular basis. She was kind enough to share her flourless chocolate torte recipe with my wife, who has made countless of them over the years, and we think of Sheila every time we eat one. Sadly now, we will fondly remember her with each future torte.

Sheila came from a large family, and she was close with her many siblings. She did her best to care for her troubled brother. Sheila knew he owned a gun, and in fact, he had a concealed carry permit. She insisted that he not bring it to her home. For reasons we may never know, her brother did not honor that request on Christmas eve, and brought his gun to her home and shot and killed her.
