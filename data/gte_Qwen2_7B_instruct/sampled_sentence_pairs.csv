queen beatrix of the netherlands abdicates in favour of son,"NEW DELHI: The restrictions imposed by the army on its personnel and formations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is posing challenges to its internal functioning.Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties. While this is also affecting the training routines of troops, reduction in attendance at the headquarters is set to slow down other work as well, said officials.The steps are aimed at ensuring social distancing and preventing contagion. It has created an unprecedented situation, forcing the army to improvise, especially because troops eat, sleep and train together within confined spaces. For example, one particular unit has now divided troops into teams that live in different areas, while ensuring that only one team uses the common toilets at a time. Training is conducted in small batches, and the equipment is sanitised every time it is used.The army on Monday issued fresh instructions to all its military stations, cantonments, units and formations in the 82 districts under lockdown. These include restricted movements, functioning of only those personnel engaged in essential services and the closure of all CSD canteens Officials said the reduction in manpower in some of the army’s formations was due to the extension of leave of soldiers till April 15 and placing those who recently returned on quarantine. Those who are going on leave due to an emergency in their families will be sent for a minimum period of 30 days. “We are in a situation where we are slightly less in strength. It affects day-to-day functioning, administrative and security duties. There is an increase in the workload of those on guard duties, because there is less turnover of troops,” an official said.The manpower also gets affected because troops are tasked with manning the quarantine facilities setup by the army. However, officials said the situation was not “alarming”, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army’s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept. Last week, the army passed instructions that 35% officers and 50% junior commissioned officers (JCO) and other ranks (OR) would work from home for a week from Monday, while the next group would do this starting March 30. The lockdown in Delhi is also affecting the travel of those personnel who stay in Gurgaon and Uttar Pradesh.“Work at the headquarters has slowed, as we are working with bare essentials. The deadline for work such as submitting reports will be extended. Only emergency work will continue as it was,” an official said.The army’s complaints section for now will only be dealing with cases that are urgent. Officials said rosters had been created to divide the staff between those who work at home and those who come to the office. However, it remains to be seen what work will be given to those working from home, because files cannot be taken home due to confidentiality issues. Several issues also cannot be communicated over email due to cybersecurity threats. Moreover, JCOs and ORs are mainly clerks who are part of the filing system for letters and documents, which can be done only from the offices.Officials said training of troops had also reduced. However, this will not affect operational preparedness, because it is for a short duration and can be made up later.In relation to the unit mentioned earlier, training of troops has become more “concentrated”, because smaller batches are being trained. “This has given us an opportunity to train better. Training small groups ensures that everyone’s doubts are cleared and attention is given to each aspect. But due to the pandemic, we have to sanitise an equipment every time it is used,” an official said.This type of training comes after troops were divided into small teams that maintained a distance of 200 metre between each other. It is also being ensured that distances are being maintained between troops of a team. “Only one team can use a bathroom at a time. After the team is done, the bathroom is sanitised and only then can the other team use it. We also have separate timings for eating at the cookhouse for the teams,” the official said.A major concern for the army stations and cantonments, which are isolated areas in a city, is the civilian manpower that is coming from outside. For example, washing points and blow drying of clothes have been setup outside the gates of one of the cantonments for this manpower.",-0.11872589

queen beatrix of the netherlands abdicates in favour of son,"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

"Sarah Adina Smith’s latest will be of special interest to fans of “Black Swan” and “Bunheads”: the writer-director of “Buster’s Mal Heart” is working on a ballet drama. This calls for a celebratory plié. A press release announced that Amazon Studios and Anonymous Content have kicked off principal photography on Smith’s “Birds of Paradise.” Kristine Froseth (“The Assistant”) and Diana Silvers (“Booksmart”) star in the feature.

An adaptation of A.K. Small’s 2019 novel “Bright Burning Stars,” “Birds of Paradise” takes place at “a prestigious ballet school in Paris, where the new girl (Silvers) befriends a grieving dance prodigy (Froseth) as the dancers compete for the school’s ultimate prize: to receive a contract to join the Parisian Opera’s ballet company,” the pic’s synopsis details. “As the pressure mounts and the girls are pushed to their physical and emotional limits, their bond is tested and they’re forced to ask themselves just how far they are willing to go to win.”

Smith, who signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios last year, penned the script.

“Sarah is a talented, visionary filmmaker who we’re so happy is part of the Amazon family, and we can’t wait to bring her next story to life with ‘Birds of Paradise,'” said Julie Rapaport, Co-head of Movies at Amazon Studios. “We’re also thrilled to be working with stars Diana Silvers and Kristine Froseth who are both on the path to becoming the next household names with their undeniable talents.”

Added Smith, “I wrote these roles specifically for Kristine Froseth and Diana Silvers, who I believe are going to take the world by storm. I’m honored to take this journey with them and so thrilled to be partnering with Amazon Studios once again in pursuit of bold, unapologetic filmmaking.”

Smith’s debut feature, 2014’s “The Midnight Swim,” took home the breakthrough audience award from AFI Fest. Her follow-up, 2016’s Rami Malek-starrer “Buster’s Mal Heart,” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On the small screen, her credits include “Hanna,” “Legion,” and “Room 104.”

“I suspect that directing movies might be a lot like being a professional athlete,” Smith told us. “You have to keep your head in the game and your eye on the ball. And you can’t waste time mourning losses or celebrating wins — at least not until the game is over. Stamina, patience, precision of judgment — these are all the things I love about the job!”

When asked what advice she’d give other women directors, she said, “I would tell them to do things their own way and don’t feel like you ever have to conform to the system, because the system was largely built by men. We need to take all the good lessons from the past and from those existing systems but also not be afraid to make our own rules,” she emphasized.",a train traveling down the tracks .,-0.06472098

"three clowns in bright , multi-colored costumes .","Govt officials confirm Trump can block US companies from operating in China The US president has not made an order as yet, only requesting for US companies to move out of China.

An open database exposing records containing the sensitive data of hotel customers as well as US military personnel and officials has been disclosed by researchers.

On Monday, vpnMentor's cybersecurity team, led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, said the database belonged to Autoclerk, a service owned by Best Western Hotels and Resorts group.

Autoclerk is a reservations management system used by resorts to manage web bookings, revenue, loyalty programs, guest profiles, and payment processing.

In a report shared with ZDNet, the researchers said the open Elasticsearch database was discovered through vpnMentor's web mapping project. It was possible to access the database, given it had no encryption or security barriers whatsoever, and perform searches to examine the records contained within.

The team says that ""thousands"" of individuals were impacted, although due to ethical reasons it was not possible to examine every record in the leaking database to come up with a specific number.

Hundreds of thousands of booking reservations for guests were available to view and data including full names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, dates and travel costs, some check-in times and room numbers, and masked credit card details were also exposed.

Data breaches are a common occurrence and can end up compromising information belonging to thousands or millions of us in single cases of a successful cyberattack.

What is more uncommon, however, is that the US government and military figures have also been involved in this security incident.

It appears that one of the platforms connected to Autoclerk exposed in the breach is a contractor of the US government that deals with travel arrangements.

vpnMentor was able to view records relating to the travel arrangements of government and military personnel -- both past and future -- who are connected to the US government, military, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Within the records, for example, were logs for US Army generals visiting Russia and Israel, among other countries.

Autoclerk facilitates communication between different hospitality platforms, and it appears that a substantial portion of the data originated from external platforms. In total, the database -- hosted by AWS -- contained over 179GB of data.

At the time of writing it has not been possible to track the overall owner of the database due to the ""number of external origin points and sheer size of the data exposed,"" the team says.

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) was informed of the leak on September 13 but did not respond to the researcher's findings.

vpnMentor then reached out to the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, and seven days later, the team contacted a representative of the Pentagon who promised swift action. Access to the database was revoked on October 2.

"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.",A man is running,-0.04838476

The woman is lovingly cooking something,"Acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother and his uncle are under investigation for assault.

Police confirmed that the king's spokesperson, Babalo Papu, was rescued from an alleged attack.

The latest drama comes in the midst of a war between Azenathi and his father, AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

Babalo Papu, an advisor to AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, has approached police to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family - including acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo.

Papu has accused Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother Buyiswa Majiki and Azenathi's spokesperson, uncle and advisor, Siganeko Dalindyebo, and others of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH).

Majiki is an Eastern Cape High Court judge and the former wife of Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

READ | King Dalindyebo gets backing of AbaThembu faction in royal DNA drama

Called for comment, on Thursday Majiki said: ""Indeed it came to my knowledge that a criminal case has been opened against me but I have no knowledge of these allegations or circumstances surrounding the case.""

The matter was reported to the Madeira police station in Mthatha on Wednesday evening, according to police.

It came a day after the police were called to a Maiden Farm address and rescued Papu from an alleged assault by a group of men, police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said.

On Thursday, Soci said: ""[Police] can confirm that a case of assault GBH has been opened for investigation. The complainant will be interviewed further to ascertain other information that has surfaced regarding the investigation.""

Siganeko Dalindyebo confirmed he was involved in the alleged assault, saying he found Papu talking to his wife on his premises.

I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo

Both Papu and Siganeko find themselves on opposite ends of the father-and-son battle for kingship. Papu acts as an advisor to Buyelekhaya and Siganeko to Azenathi.

""I, Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo, feel I was provoked by Babalo and the people who he was conniving with and gave him my wife's cellphone number. I felt it was an attack on my integrity and manhood and to the safety of my family and those close to me, by finding my sole enemy inside my premises.""

""How naïve can he be as a person to go to a home of a person [when] he knows they don't get along, based on the Dalindyebo succession debate, communicating with my wife and entering my gate? He can't expect me to feel safe. I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. I felt I should protect myself and loved ones from my enemy,"" Siganeko said.

Siganeko said his wife spend most of the time alone in Mthatha. He is based 50km away at Bumbane Great Place where he serves as a traditional leader and as one of the advisors to acting king Azenathi.

Meanwhile, Soci said: ""SAPS can confirm a complaint was received yesterday at about 15:00 and police were dispatched to the scene at Maiden Farm. Upon arrival, they found a visibly assaulted man and intervened by removing the injured person from immediate danger and also ensured that his vehicle was removed from the premises.""

Soci earlier said Papu had been advised to open cases of assault, crimen injuria and malicious damage to property against the ""people who assaulted him and damaged his vehicle"".

Contacted for comment, Papu responded with a short statement he had posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday night: ""I am in good shape, I cannot go into details or merits of this matter as advised by my legal counsel.

""I can only confirm that I was brutally attacked by Sganeko, Azenathi, Azenathi's body guard, [whose name was withheld] and one more guy I still need to find his name (sic).

""This is all I can say, thank you very much nge calls, sms, What'sApp shows that I am not alone (sic).

""Thank you and goodnight to all. Babalo Batembu Papu.""

News24 tried several times to get comment from Azenathi for his side of the story. Attempts included several phone calls and text messages to him since Tuesday. His phone was off and his spokesperson, Siganeko, declined to speak on his behalf, saying the acting king should speak for himself.

Father-and-son war

The latest drama came a day after AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court for assault. He disowned Azenathi and his claim to the throne, demanding a paternity test.

The assault case was opened by Azenathi on 13 March after Dalindyebo allegedly trespassed on the Bumbane Great Place palace, outside Mthatha, and allegedly used an axe to attack Azenathi at around 03:00.

National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 7 December for further investigation.

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is currently staying at Nkululekweni residence in Mthatha, following his early release from prison in December. He only served four years of his 12-year sentence when President Cyril Ramaphosa granted him special remission parole as part of a larger category of offenders.

He had been sent to jail in 2015 for arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. He was found guilty of terrorising his subjects in the 1990s.

The father-and-son war dates to 2016 when Azenathi went against his incarcerated father's advice and ascended to the throne.

The king wanted his wife to act on his behalf and had written a series of prison letters advising the then University of Free State student, Azenathi, to focus on his studies.",-0.043698587

queen beatrix of the netherlands abdicates in favour of son,"By Express News Service

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",-0.036632754

Outside of the Westway Community Center in Federal Way, a memorial honors the life of a 19-year-old man who was shot and killed Monday night.

Just after 10:40 p.m. April 20, Federal Way police responded to reports of a shooting at the community center in the 33400 block of 21st Avenue SW. A male victim was found near the building, and although life-saving measures were attempted by first responders, he died at the scene.

The victim has been identified as 19-year-old Damien Helmbrecht. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso and the death has been ruled a homicide, according to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Candles, bouquets of flowers, balloons, empty liquor bottles and handwritten notes are now placed at the corner of the community center’s driveway.

Tucked in a bundle of pink roses, a handwritten note reads: “My son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.”

A motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Federal Way police have not located any suspects. Investigation of the incident is still underway.

"AbaThembu nation's acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Monday for assault.

He was arrested last Thursday for allegedly attacking his father King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo's advisor, Babalo Papu.

Azenathi's court appearance comes a week after his father appeared in court for assaulting him at the family's royal palace.

AbaThembu nation's acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo briefly appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and pointing a firearm.

National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 5 August for further investigation.

Azenathi was arrested on Thursday for allegedly attacking his father King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo's advisor, Babalo Papu, on Tuesday.

Papu approached the police on Wednesday to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family, including Azenathi.

When asked for comment, police spokesperson Sibongile Soci would not be drawn into discussing other suspects in the case.

Azenathi's uncle and advisor Siganeko Dalindyebo is on record as admitting that he defended himself from Papu during the altercation.

An open database exposing records containing the sensitive data of hotel customers as well as US military personnel and officials has been disclosed by researchers.

On Monday, vpnMentor's cybersecurity team, led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, said the database belonged to Autoclerk, a service owned by Best Western Hotels and Resorts group.

Autoclerk is a reservations management system used by resorts to manage web bookings, revenue, loyalty programs, guest profiles, and payment processing.

In a report shared with ZDNet, the researchers said the open Elasticsearch database was discovered through vpnMentor's web mapping project. It was possible to access the database, given it had no encryption or security barriers whatsoever, and perform searches to examine the records contained within.

The team says that ""thousands"" of individuals were impacted, although due to ethical reasons it was not possible to examine every record in the leaking database to come up with a specific number.

Hundreds of thousands of booking reservations for guests were available to view and data including full names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, dates and travel costs, some check-in times and room numbers, and masked credit card details were also exposed.

Data breaches are a common occurrence and can end up compromising information belonging to thousands or millions of us in single cases of a successful cyberattack.

What is more uncommon, however, is that the US government and military figures have also been involved in this security incident.

It appears that one of the platforms connected to Autoclerk exposed in the breach is a contractor of the US government that deals with travel arrangements.

vpnMentor was able to view records relating to the travel arrangements of government and military personnel -- both past and future -- who are connected to the US government, military, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Within the records, for example, were logs for US Army generals visiting Russia and Israel, among other countries.

Autoclerk facilitates communication between different hospitality platforms, and it appears that a substantial portion of the data originated from external platforms. In total, the database -- hosted by AWS -- contained over 179GB of data.

Members of an international criminal group, smuggling people from mainland Europe to the United Kingdom, had been intercepted at Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport, the Finnish Border Guard said on Thursday.

The human traffickers were identified when a Swedish citizen and a Kuwaiti, who had used another person’s Swedish passport, were arrested at the airport in January.

The two men were on their way from Paris via Helsinki to London, the Border Guard said.

According to a preliminary investigation launched by the Crime Prevention Unit of the Gulf of Finland Coast Guard District, it was not the Swedish man’s first such journey to Finland.

Between December 2019 and January 2020, he is suspected to have smuggled two other foreigners from Finland to the UK by using other people’s passports.

The investigation has also found that the Swedish citizen caught in Finland had applied for asylum in the UK as a Kuwaiti by providing false personal information to the local authorities.

The criminal offences under investigation in Finland are part of a series of operations, in which people have been smuggled from mainland Europe through various countries to the UK, the Border Guard said.

The acts are suspected to have been carried out by an influential professional smuggling ring in Sweden and the UK.

The criminal gang is suspected of having charged the trafficked persons around 8,000 euros ($8,600) for each trip.

During the investigation, close international cooperation was established with the support of Europol (the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) and Eurojust (a European Union agency dealing with judicial cooperation in criminal matters).

Members of the smuggling ring have been caught in both Sweden and the UK, where local authorities conducted home searches and arrests.

A suspect in Finland, the Swedish citizen has been imprisoned since the end of January 2020 on suspicion of organising a serious illegal entry.

The investigation into the other members of the criminal ring continues in Finland and abroad, the Border Guard said.

In the previous task, Sidharth chose to save Paras. When confronted by Salman, he confessed that he picked Paras because he couldn’t decide between Shehnaaz and Arti. Soon after Salman’s exit, Shehnaaz and Sidharth had an argument. The two also had an argument with Arti regarding the same issue.

expose to cool or cold air so as to cool or freshen .,"Acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother and his uncle are under investigation for assault.

Police confirmed that the king's spokesperson, Babalo Papu, was rescued from an alleged attack.

The latest drama comes in the midst of a war between Azenathi and his father, AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

Babalo Papu, an advisor to AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, has approached police to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family - including acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo.

Papu has accused Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother Buyiswa Majiki and Azenathi's spokesperson, uncle and advisor, Siganeko Dalindyebo, and others of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH).

Majiki is an Eastern Cape High Court judge and the former wife of Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

READ | King Dalindyebo gets backing of AbaThembu faction in royal DNA drama

Called for comment, on Thursday Majiki said: ""Indeed it came to my knowledge that a criminal case has been opened against me but I have no knowledge of these allegations or circumstances surrounding the case.""

The matter was reported to the Madeira police station in Mthatha on Wednesday evening, according to police.

It came a day after the police were called to a Maiden Farm address and rescued Papu from an alleged assault by a group of men, police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said.

On Thursday, Soci said: ""[Police] can confirm that a case of assault GBH has been opened for investigation. The complainant will be interviewed further to ascertain other information that has surfaced regarding the investigation.""

Siganeko Dalindyebo confirmed he was involved in the alleged assault, saying he found Papu talking to his wife on his premises.

I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo

Both Papu and Siganeko find themselves on opposite ends of the father-and-son battle for kingship. Papu acts as an advisor to Buyelekhaya and Siganeko to Azenathi.

""I, Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo, feel I was provoked by Babalo and the people who he was conniving with and gave him my wife's cellphone number. I felt it was an attack on my integrity and manhood and to the safety of my family and those close to me, by finding my sole enemy inside my premises.""

""How naïve can he be as a person to go to a home of a person [when] he knows they don't get along, based on the Dalindyebo succession debate, communicating with my wife and entering my gate? He can't expect me to feel safe. I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. I felt I should protect myself and loved ones from my enemy,"" Siganeko said.

Siganeko said his wife spend most of the time alone in Mthatha. He is based 50km away at Bumbane Great Place where he serves as a traditional leader and as one of the advisors to acting king Azenathi.

Meanwhile, Soci said: ""SAPS can confirm a complaint was received yesterday at about 15:00 and police were dispatched to the scene at Maiden Farm. Upon arrival, they found a visibly assaulted man and intervened by removing the injured person from immediate danger and also ensured that his vehicle was removed from the premises.""

Soci earlier said Papu had been advised to open cases of assault, crimen injuria and malicious damage to property against the ""people who assaulted him and damaged his vehicle"".

Contacted for comment, Papu responded with a short statement he had posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday night: ""I am in good shape, I cannot go into details or merits of this matter as advised by my legal counsel.

""I can only confirm that I was brutally attacked by Sganeko, Azenathi, Azenathi's body guard, [whose name was withheld] and one more guy I still need to find his name (sic).

""This is all I can say, thank you very much nge calls, sms, What'sApp shows that I am not alone (sic).

""Thank you and goodnight to all. Babalo Batembu Papu.""

News24 tried several times to get comment from Azenathi for his side of the story. Attempts included several phone calls and text messages to him since Tuesday. His phone was off and his spokesperson, Siganeko, declined to speak on his behalf, saying the acting king should speak for himself.

Father-and-son war

The latest drama came a day after AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court for assault. He disowned Azenathi and his claim to the throne, demanding a paternity test.

The assault case was opened by Azenathi on 13 March after Dalindyebo allegedly trespassed on the Bumbane Great Place palace, outside Mthatha, and allegedly used an axe to attack Azenathi at around 03:00.

National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 7 December for further investigation.

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is currently staying at Nkululekweni residence in Mthatha, following his early release from prison in December. He only served four years of his 12-year sentence when President Cyril Ramaphosa granted him special remission parole as part of a larger category of offenders.

He had been sent to jail in 2015 for arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. He was found guilty of terrorising his subjects in the 1990s.

The father-and-son war dates to 2016 when Azenathi went against his incarcerated father's advice and ascended to the throne.

The king wanted his wife to act on his behalf and had written a series of prison letters advising the then University of Free State student, Azenathi, to focus on his studies.",0.07548024

An open database exposing records containing the sensitive data of hotel customers as well as US military personnel and officials has been disclosed by researchers.

On Monday, vpnMentor's cybersecurity team, led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, said the database belonged to Autoclerk, a service owned by Best Western Hotels and Resorts group.

Autoclerk is a reservations management system used by resorts to manage web bookings, revenue, loyalty programs, guest profiles, and payment processing.

In a report shared with ZDNet, the researchers said the open Elasticsearch database was discovered through vpnMentor's web mapping project. It was possible to access the database, given it had no encryption or security barriers whatsoever, and perform searches to examine the records contained within.

The team says that ""thousands"" of individuals were impacted, although due to ethical reasons it was not possible to examine every record in the leaking database to come up with a specific number.

Hundreds of thousands of booking reservations for guests were available to view and data including full names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, dates and travel costs, some check-in times and room numbers, and masked credit card details were also exposed.

Data breaches are a common occurrence and can end up compromising information belonging to thousands or millions of us in single cases of a successful cyberattack.

What is more uncommon, however, is that the US government and military figures have also been involved in this security incident.

It appears that one of the platforms connected to Autoclerk exposed in the breach is a contractor of the US government that deals with travel arrangements.

vpnMentor was able to view records relating to the travel arrangements of government and military personnel -- both past and future -- who are connected to the US government, military, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Within the records, for example, were logs for US Army generals visiting Russia and Israel, among other countries.

Autoclerk facilitates communication between different hospitality platforms, and it appears that a substantial portion of the data originated from external platforms. In total, the database -- hosted by AWS -- contained over 179GB of data.

At the time of writing it has not been possible to track the overall owner of the database due to the ""number of external origin points and sheer size of the data exposed,"" the team says.

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) was informed of the leak on September 13 but did not respond to the researcher's findings.

vpnMentor then reached out to the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, and seven days later, the team contacted a representative of the Pentagon who promised swift action. Access to the database was revoked on October 2.

""The greatest risk posed by this leak is to the US government and military,"" the team says. ""Significant amounts of sensitive employee and military personnel data could now be in the public domain. This gives invaluable insight into the operations and activities of the US government and military personnel. The national security implications for the US government and military are wide-ranging and serious.""

ZDNet has reached out to US-CERT and affected parties and will update when we hear back.

singapore shares open higher on thursday,"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.",0.1093709

a red haired women in black is posing for a man while resting on a tree .,"Sarah Adina Smith’s latest will be of special interest to fans of “Black Swan” and “Bunheads”: the writer-director of “Buster’s Mal Heart” is working on a ballet drama. This calls for a celebratory plié. A press release announced that Amazon Studios and Anonymous Content have kicked off principal photography on Smith’s “Birds of Paradise.” Kristine Froseth (“The Assistant”) and Diana Silvers (“Booksmart”) star in the feature.

An adaptation of A.K. Small’s 2019 novel “Bright Burning Stars,” “Birds of Paradise” takes place at “a prestigious ballet school in Paris, where the new girl (Silvers) befriends a grieving dance prodigy (Froseth) as the dancers compete for the school’s ultimate prize: to receive a contract to join the Parisian Opera’s ballet company,” the pic’s synopsis details. “As the pressure mounts and the girls are pushed to their physical and emotional limits, their bond is tested and they’re forced to ask themselves just how far they are willing to go to win.”

Smith, who signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios last year, penned the script.

“Sarah is a talented, visionary filmmaker who we’re so happy is part of the Amazon family, and we can’t wait to bring her next story to life with ‘Birds of Paradise,'” said Julie Rapaport, Co-head of Movies at Amazon Studios. “We’re also thrilled to be working with stars Diana Silvers and Kristine Froseth who are both on the path to becoming the next household names with their undeniable talents.”

Added Smith, “I wrote these roles specifically for Kristine Froseth and Diana Silvers, who I believe are going to take the world by storm. I’m honored to take this journey with them and so thrilled to be partnering with Amazon Studios once again in pursuit of bold, unapologetic filmmaking.”

Smith’s debut feature, 2014’s “The Midnight Swim,” took home the breakthrough audience award from AFI Fest. Her follow-up, 2016’s Rami Malek-starrer “Buster’s Mal Heart,” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On the small screen, her credits include “Hanna,” “Legion,” and “Room 104.”

“I suspect that directing movies might be a lot like being a professional athlete,” Smith told us. “You have to keep your head in the game and your eye on the ball. And you can’t waste time mourning losses or celebrating wins — at least not until the game is over. Stamina, patience, precision of judgment — these are all the things I love about the job!”

When asked what advice she’d give other women directors, she said, “I would tell them to do things their own way and don’t feel like you ever have to conform to the system, because the system was largely built by men. We need to take all the good lessons from the past and from those existing systems but also not be afraid to make our own rules,” she emphasized.",0.18065564

"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

"AbaThembu nation's acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Monday for assault.

He was arrested last Thursday for allegedly attacking his father King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo's advisor, Babalo Papu.

Azenathi's court appearance comes a week after his father appeared in court for assaulting him at the family's royal palace.

AbaThembu nation's acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo briefly appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and pointing a firearm.

National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 5 August for further investigation.

Azenathi was arrested on Thursday for allegedly attacking his father King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo's advisor, Babalo Papu, on Tuesday.

Papu approached the police on Wednesday to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family, including Azenathi.

When asked for comment, police spokesperson Sibongile Soci would not be drawn into discussing other suspects in the case.

Azenathi's uncle and advisor Siganeko Dalindyebo is on record as admitting that he defended himself from Papu during the altercation.

Azenathi's court appearance comes exactly a week after his father, Buyelekhaya, appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court for assault.

The assault case was opened by Azenathi on 13 March after Buyelekhaya allegedly trespassed on the Bumbane Great Place palace, outside Mthatha, and allegedly used an axe to attack Azenathi at around 03:00.

stocks slump on wall street,"No Patrick Beverley. No Lou Williams. No Terance Mann.

Yes, Derrick Walton Jr.

The 6-foot point guard from Michigan — via the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, Lithuanian club Zalgiris Kaunas and Germany’s Alba Berlin — finished 2019 by further ingratiating himself with Clippers’ fandom and his teammates alike.

Walton, 24, chalked up a career-high 10 points on 4-of-5 shooting to buoy the short-handed Clippers on Tuesday in a convincing 105-87 victory over the Sacramento Kings.

“Yessssir boyyy hooping,” tweeted Beverley, who missed the first of what’s expected to be a few games with a sprained right wrist.

Walton was, indeed, hooping: He curled comfortably around a Montrezl Harrell screen and sank a jumper; he buried a wide-open rainbow 3-pointer from the top of the arc; he buried another in a defender’s face; he recovered after being blocked by Bogdan Bogdanovic by popping up for another two points from the elbow — and looked exceedingly comfortable all the while.

“He’s just solid, he knows he can score, he knows he can shoot the ball,” coach Doc Rivers told reporters in Sacramento who asked about Walton, who once scored 41 points in a G League game for the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

“It’s like the league doesn’t know he can do that so they’re going to keep leaving him open. He’s not going to hesitate.”

Walton isn’t the flinching type. During his televised postgame interview with Fox Sports’ Kristina Pink, he answered a question about what he’s looking forward to in the new year — which tips off for the Clippers (24-11) on Thursday against the 12-22 Detroit Pistons (7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Prime Ticket) and former Clippers star Blake Griffin, who’s been nursing a sore knee.

“Just being a part of something special,” Walton told Pink in response to her question. “We’re preparing for something big. But you try to take it a day at a time…”

At that point, veteran forward Moe Harkless interrupted, draping a towel over Walton’s head and giving the guard an affectionate noogie — which did not derail Walton’s train of thought: “… and know we got an end goal and just try to build blocks to make sure, at the end of the day, we’re most prepared for what we’re trying to get accomplished.”

Before Walton was called up from Ontario to join the L.A. Clippers on Dec. 1, Walton was preparing for his current opportunity by stuffing stat sheets in the G League, with 13.4 points, 7.2 assists 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 steals in his five games with Agua Caliente.

Now, in 17 contests with L.A., he’s shooting an 55.6 percent from the field, 47.1 percent from 3-point range and is one of six regular Clippers with a positive — plus 1.2 — net plus-minus (the net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions).

Just before this season began, Walton offered a hint of what he believed he could contribute.

“I feel like I’m always silently confident,” he said. “Everything about this situation is about fitting and opportunities.”

"Waksal pleaded guilty to insider trading charges last year, and he is scheduled to be sentenced June 10.","Sarah Adina Smith’s latest will be of special interest to fans of “Black Swan” and “Bunheads”: the writer-director of “Buster’s Mal Heart” is working on a ballet drama. This calls for a celebratory plié. A press release announced that Amazon Studios and Anonymous Content have kicked off principal photography on Smith’s “Birds of Paradise.” Kristine Froseth (“The Assistant”) and Diana Silvers (“Booksmart”) star in the feature.

An adaptation of A.K. Small’s 2019 novel “Bright Burning Stars,” “Birds of Paradise” takes place at “a prestigious ballet school in Paris, where the new girl (Silvers) befriends a grieving dance prodigy (Froseth) as the dancers compete for the school’s ultimate prize: to receive a contract to join the Parisian Opera’s ballet company,” the pic’s synopsis details. “As the pressure mounts and the girls are pushed to their physical and emotional limits, their bond is tested and they’re forced to ask themselves just how far they are willing to go to win.”

Smith, who signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios last year, penned the script.

“Sarah is a talented, visionary filmmaker who we’re so happy is part of the Amazon family, and we can’t wait to bring her next story to life with ‘Birds of Paradise,'” said Julie Rapaport, Co-head of Movies at Amazon Studios. “We’re also thrilled to be working with stars Diana Silvers and Kristine Froseth who are both on the path to becoming the next household names with their undeniable talents.”

Added Smith, “I wrote these roles specifically for Kristine Froseth and Diana Silvers, who I believe are going to take the world by storm. I’m honored to take this journey with them and so thrilled to be partnering with Amazon Studios once again in pursuit of bold, unapologetic filmmaking.”

Smith’s debut feature, 2014’s “The Midnight Swim,” took home the breakthrough audience award from AFI Fest. Her follow-up, 2016’s Rami Malek-starrer “Buster’s Mal Heart,” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On the small screen, her credits include “Hanna,” “Legion,” and “Room 104.”

“I suspect that directing movies might be a lot like being a professional athlete,” Smith told us. “You have to keep your head in the game and your eye on the ball. And you can’t waste time mourning losses or celebrating wins — at least not until the game is over. Stamina, patience, precision of judgment — these are all the things I love about the job!”

When asked what advice she’d give other women directors, she said, “I would tell them to do things their own way and don’t feel like you ever have to conform to the system, because the system was largely built by men. We need to take all the good lessons from the past and from those existing systems but also not be afraid to make our own rules,” she emphasized.",0.5066913

"By Express News Service

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",A kid sitting on a soccer ball at the park.,0.54643214

"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.",Primary Care Trusts and Mental Health Trusts have also been formally rated for the first time this year.,0.5838194

"AbaThembu nation's acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Monday for assault.

He was arrested last Thursday for allegedly attacking his father King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo's advisor, Babalo Papu.

Azenathi's court appearance comes a week after his father appeared in court for assaulting him at the family's royal palace.

AbaThembu nation's acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo briefly appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and pointing a firearm.

National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 5 August for further investigation.

Azenathi was arrested on Thursday for allegedly attacking his father King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo's advisor, Babalo Papu, on Tuesday.

Papu approached the police on Wednesday to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family, including Azenathi.

When asked for comment, police spokesperson Sibongile Soci would not be drawn into discussing other suspects in the case.

Azenathi's uncle and advisor Siganeko Dalindyebo is on record as admitting that he defended himself from Papu during the altercation.

Azenathi's court appearance comes exactly a week after his father, Buyelekhaya, appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court for assault.

The assault case was opened by Azenathi on 13 March after Buyelekhaya allegedly trespassed on the Bumbane Great Place palace, outside Mthatha, and allegedly used an axe to attack Azenathi at around 03:00.

Buyelekhaya has since disowned his son and is demanding a paternity test.","Acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother and his uncle are under investigation for assault.

Police confirmed that the king's spokesperson, Babalo Papu, was rescued from an alleged attack.

The latest drama comes in the midst of a war between Azenathi and his father, AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

Babalo Papu, an advisor to AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, has approached police to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family - including acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo.

Papu has accused Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother Buyiswa Majiki and Azenathi's spokesperson, uncle and advisor, Siganeko Dalindyebo, and others of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH).

Majiki is an Eastern Cape High Court judge and the former wife of Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

Called for comment, on Thursday Majiki said: ""Indeed it came to my knowledge that a criminal case has been opened against me but I have no knowledge of these allegations or circumstances surrounding the case.""

The matter was reported to the Madeira police station in Mthatha on Wednesday evening, according to police.

It came a day after the police were called to a Maiden Farm address and rescued Papu from an alleged assault by a group of men, police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said.

On Thursday, Soci said: ""[Police] can confirm that a case of assault GBH has been opened for investigation. The complainant will be interviewed further to ascertain other information that has surfaced regarding the investigation.""

Siganeko Dalindyebo confirmed he was involved in the alleged assault, saying he found Papu talking to his wife on his premises.

I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo

Both Papu and Siganeko find themselves on opposite ends of the father-and-son battle for kingship. Papu acts as an advisor to Buyelekhaya and Siganeko to Azenathi.

""I, Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo, feel I was provoked by Babalo and the people who he was conniving with and gave him my wife's cellphone number. I felt it was an attack on my integrity and manhood and to the safety of my family and those close to me, by finding my sole enemy inside my premises.""

""How naïve can he be as a person to go to a home of a person [when] he knows they don't get along, based on the Dalindyebo succession debate, communicating with my wife and entering my gate? He can't expect me to feel safe. I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. I felt I should protect myself and loved ones from my enemy,"" Siganeko said.

Siganeko said his wife spend most of the time alone in Mthatha. He is based 50km away at Bumbane Great Place where he serves as a traditional leader and as one of the advisors to acting king Azenathi.

Meanwhile, Soci said: ""SAPS can confirm a complaint was received yesterday at about 15:00 and police were dispatched to the scene at Maiden Farm. Upon arrival, they found a visibly assaulted man and intervened by removing the injured person from immediate danger and also ensured that his vehicle was removed from the premises.""

Soci earlier said Papu had been advised to open cases of assault, crimen injuria and malicious damage to property against the ""people who assaulted him and damaged his vehicle"".

Contacted for comment, Papu responded with a short statement he had posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday night: ""I am in good shape, I cannot go into details or merits of this matter as advised by my legal counsel.

""I can only confirm that I was brutally attacked by Sganeko, Azenathi, Azenathi's body guard, [whose name was withheld] and one more guy I still need to find his name (sic).

""This is all I can say, thank you very much nge calls, sms, What'sApp shows that I am not alone (sic).

""Thank you and goodnight to all. Babalo Batembu Papu.""

News24 tried several times to get comment from Azenathi for his side of the story. Attempts included several phone calls and text messages to him since Tuesday. His phone was off and his spokesperson, Siganeko, declined to speak on his behalf, saying the acting king should speak for himself.

Father-and-son war

The latest drama came a day after AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court for assault. He disowned Azenathi and his claim to the throne, demanding a paternity test.

The assault case was opened by Azenathi on 13 March after Dalindyebo allegedly trespassed on the Bumbane Great Place palace, outside Mthatha, and allegedly used an axe to attack Azenathi at around 03:00.

National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 7 December for further investigation.

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is currently staying at Nkululekweni residence in Mthatha, following his early release from prison in December. He only served four years of his 12-year sentence when President Cyril Ramaphosa granted him special remission parole as part of a larger category of offenders.

He had been sent to jail in 2015 for arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. He was found guilty of terrorising his subjects in the 1990s.

The father-and-son war dates to 2016 when Azenathi went against his incarcerated father's advice and ascended to the throne.

The king wanted his wife to act on his behalf and had written a series of prison letters advising the then University of Free State student, Azenathi, to focus on his studies.",0.8759448
