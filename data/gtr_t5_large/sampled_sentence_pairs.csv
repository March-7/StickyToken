"Because pores exist everywhere on our bodies, there also exists the possibility for breakouts everywhere on our bodies. (Great!) But some of those pores are more prone to acne than others, like those that are more exposed to sweat, bacteria, oil, inflammation, and other pore-clogging, pimple-causing phenomena â and that includes your chest. I reached out to New York City-based dermatologists Dr. Robyn Gmyrek and Dr. Kenneth Howe to understand what causes chest acne in the first place, and how to get rid of chest acne should you want to treat these breakouts.

According to Dr. Gmyrek, chest acne is basically the same thing as facial acne. âWhen a pore gets clogged by dead skin cells at the opening, sebum gets trapped inside. That creates inflammation, which leads to pimples and an overgrowth of bacteria,â she explains. Also like facial acne, the causes for chest acne are often multi-pronged. Some people have a genetic predisposition to acne, while some might experience hormonal breakouts. But along with biological factors, Dr. Gmyrek says that chest acne can be caused or worsened by excessive sweating, especially while wearing tight-fitting clothing. Occlusive clothing, like sports bras and compression shirts, trap sweat and oil, which leads to more bacteria and inflammation. Et voila: chest acne.

Beyond showering ASAP after a workout, you can also use pimple-fighting products to keep chest acne at bay. But be mindful of the products youâre using to treat chest acne, as Dr. Gmyrek warns that âyour chest skin is more sensitive to being dried out or irritated by medicated acne products than facial skin.â So if youâre using a concentrated spot treatment, use it sparingly and occasionally so you donât exacerbate dryness.

Dr. Howe adds that the risk of scarring is greater with chest acne, âparticularly deeper acne cysts on the central chest"" â so whatever you do, donât pick at your spots. Dr. Howe says those resulting scabs and scars can take months to clear up. And if over-the-counter remedies arenât working for you, Dr. Howe recommends paying a visit to your dermatologist. âProbably because the area is covered by clothes, a lot of patients neglect getting treatment for their chest,â he says. âBut why continue to suffer, when we can clear it up?â

That said, there are ways to treat chest acne at home. Start with these five dermatologist-approved products, listed ahead, which can help you prevent, treat, and get rid of chest acne for good.

Try A Spray-On Exfoliant Paulaâs Choice Clear Acne Body Spray $25 | Amazon See on Amazon This Paulaâs Choice Clear Acne Body Spray contains 2% salicylic acid, a mainstay ingredient for treating acne. But in this formula, soothing and hydrating ingredients like allantoin, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid counteract salicylic acid's drying effects, which might otherwise be too intense for the thin skin on your chest. Dr. Gmyrek points out that this spray can be helpful for treating hard-to-reach back acne, too, since the pump is designed to spray at any angle. ""I love this stuff! This is the 3rd time Iâve repurchased it. I get bad breakouts on my shoulders and chest, and this spray clears them up within a few days and doesnât dry out my skin,"" commented one satisfied customer.

2. Use An Acne-Fighting Body Wash In The Shower Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash $38 | Amazon See on Amazon If you have mild to moderate chest acne, Dr. Howe recommends using an acne-fighting body wash since theyâre so easy to incorporate into your daily routine. (That said, Dr. Howe says that more severe cases of body acne might not respond to foaming cleansers, since they simply aren't left on long enough to thoroughly penetrate skin.) Like the Paulaâs Choice body spray, the Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash contains 2% salicylic acid, which is the highest percentage of salicylic acid permitted in an over-the-counter product. The formula also contains soothing ingredients like aloe, jojoba esters, and camellia leaf extract to keep dryness and inflammation under control. Dr. Gmyrek suggests using this body wash with a gently exfoliating washcloth or body scrubber to maximize its pore-cleansing powers.

3. Always Apply Sunscreen EltaMD UV Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 $24 | Amazon See on Amazon I probably donât need to tell you that tanning is bad for literally everything to do with your skin, but Dr. Howe specifically warns against tanning as a quick fix for body acne. âThat might work for a few weeks,â he says, âbut once youâre out of the sun your acne will undergo a rebound flare, and come roaring back even worse. Plus, youâll have caused lifelong sun damage to your exposed skin.â For sun protection, Dr. Gmyrek swears by EltaMD products for acne-prone skin â theyâre lightweight, non-comedogenic, and guard your skin against both UVB and UVA rays (the former are responsible for sunburns, the latter cause sun spots, and both can cause skin cancer). Use EltaMD UV Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 on your chest (and the rest of your body) for up to 80 minutes of acne-safe, water-resistant sun protection. The non-greasy formula doesnât leave behind a white cast, so it works beautifully on all skin tones.

4. Keep Pores Clean With Exfoliating Pads Neutrogena Rapid Clear Treatment Pads $7 | Amazon See on Amazon Using salicylic acid-soaked treatment pads can be an effective, mess-free, and oddly satisfying way to treat chest acne. These Neutrogena Rapid Clear Treatment Pads clear away dirt, oil, and other bacteria to treat current acne flare-ups and prevent future breakouts. A word of warning: Since theyâre intended for treating facial acne, these pads are highly concentrated and might be too drying for run-of-the-mill chest acne. Reserve them for more severe breakouts, or if you have very oily skin.",a part of a forked or branching shape .,0.42060566

The victim was taken to a hospital, according to the Cypress Police Department.

The suspect fled the scene and no description was released.

Investigators believe the shooting was an isolated incident with no ongoing danger to the public.

supreme court to hear michigan affirmative action case,"As COVID-19 continues to impact the lives of Canadians, the federal government has launched an online portal and app dedicated to mental health and wellness.

The app and the online Wellness Together site will connect people with peer support workers, social workers, psychologists and other professionals for confidential chat sessions or phone calls.

Itâs also a place to find credible information about how to address mental health and substance use issues.

Users will be able to access different levels of support depending on their needs, ranging from information and self-assessment tools, to the opportunity to chat with professionals.

A number of organizations played a part in crafting the portal, including Stepped Care Solutions, Kids Help Phone, Homewood Health, Greenspace Health, the Mental Health Commission of Canada, and the Canadian Psychological Association.

âMental wellness is difficult to maintain with the disruptions happening now,â said Patty Hajdu, Federal Minister of Health. âItâs not easy to maintain a routine. People in every community are struggling and need our help. Thatâs why we are acting today to make it easier for Canadians to identify, understand and address issues they are facing, with multiple tools and resources available on one platform.â",0.51580787

( cause to ) lengthen or expand in time or some abstract realm,"The family of one of the men wounded in the stabbing rampage in Rockland County has released a photograph of his devastating injuries â showing him on a respirator with a heavily sutured, bloodied head.

âThis is the visual state of Josef Neumann who has been stabbed at the Hanukkah celebration Saturday night in the Forshay area of #Monsey,â the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council in Hudson Valley said in a Twitter post, along with the hashtag #MeJew.

The 70-year-old father of seven was in critical condition after suffering a skull fracture and undergoing surgery on Sunday, his daughter previously told The Post.

Neumann was stabbed multiple times, when alleged machete-wielding madman Thomas Grafton stormed the Monsey house of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg on Saturday, injuring five Hasidic Jews.

âThe knife penetrated his skull directly into the brain,â said his family, adding that he may never wake up. He also was cut three times on the head, once on the neck and his right arm was âshattered.â

âOur fatherâs status is so dire that no surgery has yet been performed on the right arm,â the familyâs statement said.

The four other victims â including the rabbiâs 25-year-old son â had been treated and were released from the hospital by Sunday.

Federal prosecutors say the accused assailant kept journals filled with anti-Semitic writing and used a cellphone to search for âZionist Temples,â including on Staten Island.

editors from around the world urge turkey to protect media,"Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa took to Instagram to share a heartbreaking video of the basketball icon talking about coaching their daughter Gianna

Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa pays tribute to icon and their daughter two months after tragedy

Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa has paid a touching tribute to the icon and their daughter Gianna two months after their tragic deaths.

Vanessa took to her Instagram account on Thursday to share a heartbreaking video of Kobe talking about coaching Gianna.

Gianna, and Kobe lost their lives in a helicopter crash in January, exactly two months before Vanessa posted the tribute.

The 13-year-old was an aspiring basketball player and Kobe, who played for the Lakers, coached her Amateur Athletic Union team.

In the video shared by Vanessa, Kobe said: ""She started out playing soccer, which is one of my favorite sports as well.

""But then, when she asked about learning the game of basketball, I started teaching her piece by piece, and she started enjoying it and loving it and now she plays every day.

""It's been a joy to watch her grow and to be there every day for that process.

""Her temperament is a lot like mine. Sheâs extremely competitive, very fiery, and backs down from no challenge.""

In the clip Kobe says Gianna is ""a good mix of me and good mix of her mama, so that makes her even more competitive than I am.""

Vanessa captioned the post with two broken heart emojis.

It comes after she spoke at Kobe and Gianna's memorial last month.

Speaking about Kobe, Vanessa said: ""He was mine. He was my everything. Kobe and I had been together since I was 17 years old.

""I was his first girlfriend, his first love, his wife, his best friend, his confidante and his protector. He was the most amazing husband. Kobe loved me more than I could ever express or put into words.""

Vanessa also paid honour to Gianna and revealed what she has been missing.

She said: ""I miss her sweet kisses, her cleverness, her sarcasm, her wit and that adorable sly side smile followed with a grin and burst of laughter.

""Gigi was sunshine. She brightened up my day every day. I miss looking at her beautiful face. She was always so good, a rule follower. I knew I could always count on her to do the right thing.""",0.53298724

If you are in good health and have mild illness, stay home, and take care of yourself like you would for the flu. If symptoms worsen, call your doctor. Your doctor will help make the decision whether you should get tested for COVID-19

Practice healthy hygiene habits every day to help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, such as: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Stay home when you are sick.

"The message to foreign women thinking of booking a holiday in Cyprus could hardly be more stark: if you are attacked donât expect the authorities to help you. On the contrary, reporting a rape carries a significant risk that it wonât be properly investigated, as appears to have happened to the 19-year-old British woman who went to the police in Ayia Napa in July saying she had been gang-raped. Moreover, you might end up deprived of your own liberty.

The teenager found herself convicted on Monday with inventing the whole thing, and faces a potential prison sentence when she appears at the Famagusta district court next week. Predatory young men, on the other hand, might easily come to the conclusion that they have nothing to fear.

The case now has all the ingredients of an international incident, following a highly unusual intervention from the Foreign Office. A spokesman has described events in Cyprus as âdeeply distressingâ and says that the UK is âseriously concernedâ about the young womanâs right to a fair trial. While limiting damage to the tourist industry may have been the primary concern of the Cypriot authorities, it has backfired spectacularly. The UK is also an important ally and has military bases on the island. Whatever is being said publicly, itâs likely that frantic discussions are taking place behind the scenes, seeking a way out of what is fast becoming a public relations disaster.

It simply defies belief that more than 55,000 British women are lying about being raped every year

While some elements in this shocking case are particular to Cyprus, it highlights a culture of disbelief towards victims that is almost universal. That distrust expresses itself in different ways, depending on the jurisdiction, and it appears that the investigation in Ayia Napa was flawed from the outset. In the UK, victims often complain about the length of time a rape inquiry takes, but the Cypriot investigation was over in just 12 days. How can a thorough investigation into an alleged rape with multiple perpetrators be carried out in such a short space of time? Yet all the accused boys were released and allowed to return home to Israel.

The young womanâs legal team claim that local police failed to collect evidence from the hotel room where the incident took place, didnât secure the crime scene and showed no understanding of the impact of traumatic events on the complainantâs memory.

Instead of treating her as a young and vulnerable witness, they interviewed her on her own late at night, with neither a lawyer nor a family member present. The Cypriot police do not record interviews, so there is no independent record of what happened during the seven hours before the teenager signed a âretractionâ, which she says she did under duress.

This sequence of events is a stain on the Cypriot justice system, but what lies behind it is a hugely disproportionate anxiety about false accusations. Indeed it is one of the principal myths that undermine rape investigations, even though the idea that there are high levels of false allegations is unsupported by evidence. In the UK, a handful of widely publicised cases that ended in acquittals or a decision not to proceed to trial has tainted the entire system for investigating rape. Many people do not understand that a decision not to prosecute reflects an assessment of the available evidence, and does not mean the victim was lying.

The Crown Prosecution Service denies the accusation that it has become ârisk averseâ, but there has been a 52% drop in the number of rape cases prosecuted since 2016, despite an increase of 43% in complaints to the police. According to the latest figures for the year ending in March 2019, there were 58,657 allegations of rape in England and Wales but only 1,925 successful prosecutions. Unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool misogynist, it simply defies belief that more than 55,000 women are lying about being raped every year.

Unbelievable â at last, a rape drama that gives victims a voice | Fiona Sturges Read more

The truth is actually much worse: a habit of treating women as untrustworthy witnesses has imbued our own criminal justice system with a corrosive degree of suspicion. Itâs far from unusual for victims to face intrusive demands for personal information, including school and medical records. They are made to feel as though they, rather than their alleged attackers, have shameful secrets in their past.

These developments have not gone unchallenged. The Centre for Womenâs Justice is seeking a judicial review of the way the CPS makes decisions in rape cases, while the information commissioner is investigating a complaint from myself, the London victimsâ commissioner and womenâs groups about excessive demands for complainantsâ private data.

In the meantime there can be no doubt that thousands of sexual predators are going free. Some of them, no doubt, will attack again. And while we rightly shudder at the treatment a British teenager has received in Cyprus, we should not forget that our own criminal justice system is in crisis â or that it lets down rape victims every day.

In a post on Facebook, it said: ""An unfathomable tragedy hit us shortly after midnight. Our ape building burned down to the foundation.""

Chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans are among those that burned alive. Fruit bats, birds and other animals were also killed.

However, two chimps called Bally and Limbo were saved from the flames by firefighters who heard their screams.

Both suffered minor burns and the zoo director described their last minute rescue as nothing short of ""a miracle"".

'Gorilla Kidogo and his family are alive', the zoo wrote on Facebook in the early hours of today. Both the zoo and city officials said that they didn't know the exact cause of the fire and that police are investigating. They would not confirm reports by local media that New Year's fireworks could have sparked the killer blaze. However, reports from the scene claim three banned sky lanterns were found in the charred remains of the enclosure.

The Zoo said it was thankful for the many offers of help, but added: ""We are still in shock and cannot yet say exactly if and where help is needed.""

The greenhouse-style building - which opened in 1975 - burned to the ground within a couple of hours, say reports.

Orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, marmosets, epaulet fruit bats and birds were inside at the time.

A woman on a rock is standing and looking around,"The message to foreign women thinking of booking a holiday in Cyprus could hardly be more stark: if you are attacked donât expect the authorities to help you. On the contrary, reporting a rape carries a significant risk that it wonât be properly investigated, as appears to have happened to the 19-year-old British woman who went to the police in Ayia Napa in July saying she had been gang-raped. Moreover, you might end up deprived of your own liberty.

The teenager found herself convicted on Monday with inventing the whole thing, and faces a potential prison sentence when she appears at the Famagusta district court next week. Predatory young men, on the other hand, might easily come to the conclusion that they have nothing to fear.

The case now has all the ingredients of an international incident, following a highly unusual intervention from the Foreign Office. A spokesman has described events in Cyprus as âdeeply distressingâ and says that the UK is âseriously concernedâ about the young womanâs right to a fair trial. While limiting damage to the tourist industry may have been the primary concern of the Cypriot authorities, it has backfired spectacularly. The UK is also an important ally and has military bases on the island. Whatever is being said publicly, itâs likely that frantic discussions are taking place behind the scenes, seeking a way out of what is fast becoming a public relations disaster.

It simply defies belief that more than 55,000 British women are lying about being raped every year

While some elements in this shocking case are particular to Cyprus, it highlights a culture of disbelief towards victims that is almost universal. That distrust expresses itself in different ways, depending on the jurisdiction, and it appears that the investigation in Ayia Napa was flawed from the outset. In the UK, victims often complain about the length of time a rape inquiry takes, but the Cypriot investigation was over in just 12 days. How can a thorough investigation into an alleged rape with multiple perpetrators be carried out in such a short space of time? Yet all the accused boys were released and allowed to return home to Israel.

The young womanâs legal team claim that local police failed to collect evidence from the hotel room where the incident took place, didnât secure the crime scene and showed no understanding of the impact of traumatic events on the complainantâs memory.

Instead of treating her as a young and vulnerable witness, they interviewed her on her own late at night, with neither a lawyer nor a family member present. The Cypriot police do not record interviews, so there is no independent record of what happened during the seven hours before the teenager signed a âretractionâ, which she says she did under duress.

This sequence of events is a stain on the Cypriot justice system, but what lies behind it is a hugely disproportionate anxiety about false accusations. Indeed it is one of the principal myths that undermine rape investigations, even though the idea that there are high levels of false allegations is unsupported by evidence. In the UK, a handful of widely publicised cases that ended in acquittals or a decision not to proceed to trial has tainted the entire system for investigating rape. Many people do not understand that a decision not to prosecute reflects an assessment of the available evidence, and does not mean the victim was lying.

The Crown Prosecution Service denies the accusation that it has become ârisk averseâ, but there has been a 52% drop in the number of rape cases prosecuted since 2016, despite an increase of 43% in complaints to the police. According to the latest figures for the year ending in March 2019, there were 58,657 allegations of rape in England and Wales but only 1,925 successful prosecutions. Unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool misogynist, it simply defies belief that more than 55,000 women are lying about being raped every year.

Unbelievable â at last, a rape drama that gives victims a voice | Fiona Sturges Read more

The truth is actually much worse: a habit of treating women as untrustworthy witnesses has imbued our own criminal justice system with a corrosive degree of suspicion. Itâs far from unusual for victims to face intrusive demands for personal information, including school and medical records. They are made to feel as though they, rather than their alleged attackers, have shameful secrets in their past.

These developments have not gone unchallenged. The Centre for Womenâs Justice is seeking a judicial review of the way the CPS makes decisions in rape cases, while the information commissioner is investigating a complaint from myself, the London victimsâ commissioner and womenâs groups about excessive demands for complainantsâ private data.

In the meantime there can be no doubt that thousands of sexual predators are going free. Some of them, no doubt, will attack again. And while we rightly shudder at the treatment a British teenager has received in Cyprus, we should not forget that our own criminal justice system is in crisis â or that it lets down rape victims every day.

âThis is the visual state of Josef Neumann who has been stabbed at the Hanukkah celebration Saturday night in the Forshay area of #Monsey,â the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council in Hudson Valley said in a Twitter post, along with the hashtag #MeJew.

The 70-year-old father of seven was in critical condition after suffering a skull fracture and undergoing surgery on Sunday, his daughter previously told The Post.

Neumann was stabbed multiple times, when alleged machete-wielding madman Thomas Grafton stormed the Monsey house of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg on Saturday, injuring five Hasidic Jews.

âThe knife penetrated his skull directly into the brain,â said his family, adding that he may never wake up. He also was cut three times on the head, once on the neck and his right arm was âshattered.â

âOur fatherâs status is so dire that no surgery has yet been performed on the right arm,â the familyâs statement said.

The four other victims â including the rabbiâs 25-year-old son â had been treated and were released from the hospital by Sunday.

Federal prosecutors say the accused assailant kept journals filled with anti-Semitic writing and used a cellphone to search for âZionist Temples,â including on Staten Island.

"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Trump had a fiery exchange with CNN analyst and Playboy reporter Brian Karem during the coronavirus press briefing in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, where he announced that the U.S. was halting its funding of the World Health Organization (WHO) for its errors leading up to the coronavirus pandemic.

""I know you want to blame the WHO, but I've spoken to hundreds of people across the country in the last few weeks,"" Karem began. ""They say they still can't get tested and they're not social distancing because --""

""So the governors,"" Trump interjected, ""I know your question. You ready? The governors, the governors are supposed to do testing. It's up to the governors.""

As Trump went to move on to the next reporter's question, Karem continued shouting his question.

""Quiet, quiet,"" Trump scolded the reporter. ""The governors are doing the testing. It's now not up -- and it hasn't been up -- to the federal government.""

The president called on the next reporter, but Karem persisted on asking his question, which was disrupting the press conference.

""I told them when they put this guy here, it's nothing but trouble,"" Trump said about Karem. ""He's a showboat. If you keep talking, I'll leave and you can have it out with the rest of these people. If you keep talking, I'm going to leave and you can have it out with them.""

""It's just a simple question,"" Karem said.

""Just a loudmouth,"" Trump fired back.

"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised to stand in solidarity with the United States in its struggle against the coronavirus pandemic and as it recovers from the outbreak.

In a letter sent to Donald Trump, Erdogan also said he was following with appreciation the US president's efforts to control the outbreak.

The letter was sent Tuesday along with a planeload of personal protective equipment that Turkey donated to the United States. It was made public on Wednesday.

Erdogan wrote: I am very pleased to observe that, thanks to your measures, America has taken the first steps towards normalization by achieving a downward trend in the number of new cases.

You can be sure, as a reliable and strong partner of the US, we will continue to demonstrate solidarity in every way possible, Erdogan wrote.

Turkey sent 500,000 surgical masks, 4,000 overalls, 2,000 liters (528 gallons) of disinfectant, 1,500 goggles, 400 N-95 masks and 500 face shields. Turkey has sent similar medical equipment aid to a total of 55 countries including Britain, Italy and Spain.

###","The message to foreign women thinking of booking a holiday in Cyprus could hardly be more stark: if you are attacked donât expect the authorities to help you. On the contrary, reporting a rape carries a significant risk that it wonât be properly investigated, as appears to have happened to the 19-year-old British woman who went to the police in Ayia Napa in July saying she had been gang-raped. Moreover, you might end up deprived of your own liberty.

The teenager found herself convicted on Monday with inventing the whole thing, and faces a potential prison sentence when she appears at the Famagusta district court next week. Predatory young men, on the other hand, might easily come to the conclusion that they have nothing to fear.

The case now has all the ingredients of an international incident, following a highly unusual intervention from the Foreign Office. A spokesman has described events in Cyprus as âdeeply distressingâ and says that the UK is âseriously concernedâ about the young womanâs right to a fair trial. While limiting damage to the tourist industry may have been the primary concern of the Cypriot authorities, it has backfired spectacularly. The UK is also an important ally and has military bases on the island. Whatever is being said publicly, itâs likely that frantic discussions are taking place behind the scenes, seeking a way out of what is fast becoming a public relations disaster.

It simply defies belief that more than 55,000 British women are lying about being raped every year

While some elements in this shocking case are particular to Cyprus, it highlights a culture of disbelief towards victims that is almost universal. That distrust expresses itself in different ways, depending on the jurisdiction, and it appears that the investigation in Ayia Napa was flawed from the outset. In the UK, victims often complain about the length of time a rape inquiry takes, but the Cypriot investigation was over in just 12 days. How can a thorough investigation into an alleged rape with multiple perpetrators be carried out in such a short space of time? Yet all the accused boys were released and allowed to return home to Israel.

The young womanâs legal team claim that local police failed to collect evidence from the hotel room where the incident took place, didnât secure the crime scene and showed no understanding of the impact of traumatic events on the complainantâs memory.

Instead of treating her as a young and vulnerable witness, they interviewed her on her own late at night, with neither a lawyer nor a family member present. The Cypriot police do not record interviews, so there is no independent record of what happened during the seven hours before the teenager signed a âretractionâ, which she says she did under duress.

This sequence of events is a stain on the Cypriot justice system, but what lies behind it is a hugely disproportionate anxiety about false accusations. Indeed it is one of the principal myths that undermine rape investigations, even though the idea that there are high levels of false allegations is unsupported by evidence. In the UK, a handful of widely publicised cases that ended in acquittals or a decision not to proceed to trial has tainted the entire system for investigating rape. Many people do not understand that a decision not to prosecute reflects an assessment of the available evidence, and does not mean the victim was lying.

The Crown Prosecution Service denies the accusation that it has become ârisk averseâ, but there has been a 52% drop in the number of rape cases prosecuted since 2016, despite an increase of 43% in complaints to the police. According to the latest figures for the year ending in March 2019, there were 58,657 allegations of rape in England and Wales but only 1,925 successful prosecutions. Unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool misogynist, it simply defies belief that more than 55,000 women are lying about being raped every year.

Unbelievable â at last, a rape drama that gives victims a voice | Fiona Sturges Read more

The truth is actually much worse: a habit of treating women as untrustworthy witnesses has imbued our own criminal justice system with a corrosive degree of suspicion. Itâs far from unusual for victims to face intrusive demands for personal information, including school and medical records. They are made to feel as though they, rather than their alleged attackers, have shameful secrets in their past.

These developments have not gone unchallenged. The Centre for Womenâs Justice is seeking a judicial review of the way the CPS makes decisions in rape cases, while the information commissioner is investigating a complaint from myself, the London victimsâ commissioner and womenâs groups about excessive demands for complainantsâ private data.

In the meantime there can be no doubt that thousands of sexual predators are going free. Some of them, no doubt, will attack again. And while we rightly shudder at the treatment a British teenager has received in Cyprus, we should not forget that our own criminal justice system is in crisis â or that it lets down rape victims every day.
