Macalester College in St. Paul confirmed on Monday it has appointed Dr. Suzanne Rivera as the 17th president in its 145-year history.

Dr. Rivera was appointed from the Case Western Reserve University, where she is the Vice President for Research and Technology Management.

She will take up her new role this summer, in doing so becoming the first woman and Latinx person to hold the position.

She will replace Brian Rosenberg, who will step down from his duties in May having announced his resignation last year. He has been president of the college for 17 years.

""Dr. Rivera has distinguished herself through her work as an ethicist; her record of advancing the values of service, internationalism, and multiculturalism that define our institution; and her accomplishments as a senior leader in academia,"" said Jerry Crawford, Chair of the Macalester College Board of Trustees, in a Monday press statement.

""Her depth of knowledge and strategic thinking, as well as her ability to inspire, will serve the Macalester community well as we look to the opportunities and challenges of the future. We look forward to welcoming Dr. Rivera to Macalester.""

Dr. Rivera has a BA in American Civilization from Brown University, an Ivy League school, as well as a Master's in Social Welfare from the University of California, Berkeley.

She received her Doctor of Philosophy in Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Dallas.

As well as working for CWRU, she has also held research leadership positions at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of California, Irvine, and has been involved in national social justice and equity initiatives.

""It is an incredible honor and privilege to join the Macalester family,"" Rivera said. “This is a community where curious people thrive, where individuality is celebrated, and where the purpose of education is to equip students with tools to make an impact in the wider world.""",0.623129

"Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a £9 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to £2,500 a month to help them cope with the effects of coronavirus.

The Chancellor tonight said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, will cover 80 per cent of a self-employed person's average monthly profits.

But it may not be available until June and will only be available to those who have a tax return for 2019, meaning the newly self-employed will be ineligible.

And Mr Sunak warned that the self-employed could face tax hikes in the future as part of the effort to ""right the ship"" and repair the battered public finances after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Details of the scheme came as the Department of Health announced a total of 578 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK have died as of 5pm on March 25.

Some 11,658 people have tested positive in the UK as of 9am on March 26.

Mr Sunak's scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

To qualify, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.

Up to 3.8 million people will qualify for support, with average monthly payments expected to be £940 per person.

Mr Sunak said the scheme, which will last for at least three months, ""is one of the most generous in the world"".

""It targets support to those who need help most, offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work.""

He said the measure covers 95 per cent of people who receive the majority of their income from self-employment.

But in a hint that the self-employed could be asked to pay more to the taxman in future he said it was ""now much harder to justify"" the tax breaks on offer to the self-employed if they were receiving the same level of state support.

He said everyone would be ""chipping in together to right the ship afterwards"" once the crisis is over.

A number of self-employed workers welcomed the Chancellor's measures but expressed concern about having to wait until June to claim.

Louise Barina, a production manager who lives in London, said: ""After having spoken to our landlord, he has outright said no, that we can't get a delay on our rent.

""In terms of the payment coming in June, that's really problematic for us as that's obviously three months of payment where we need to find the money for that.""

Meanwhile the Department of Health said revising its reporting approach for coronavirus deaths ""to ensure data can be verified and published in a timely, consistent way"".

A statement on Twitter said: ""Figures issued today are recorded as of 5pm on March 24 to 5pm on March 25.

""Going forwards, figures on deaths will be recorded for the 24-hour period as of 5pm the previous day. Figures on tests remain as of the 24-hour period from 9am that day.""",a dog is running through a backyard full of leaves .,0.6405375

CALL YOUR SENATOR



Please call your senators and ask them to pass the emergency House bill to help us navigate this public health and economic crisis.

Early Saturday morning, the House passed an emergency bill that would allocate billions of dollars for paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing, and other measures to help those impacted by this crisis. This is a necessary starting point that the Senate must pass now.

Unfortunately, these measures are narrow in scope, leaving 80 percent of workers unprotected. While some large employers are doing the right thing and giving employees sick leave, a national policy is the most effective measure in this time of unprecedented national crisis. We need comprehensive legislation to follow this initial bill to protect all people, especially those with the greatest health and economic risks.

We Need Comprehensive Public Health and Economic Supports



Today, 100 million people — one in three people in the US — live in or on the brink of poverty where an illness, job loss, or unexpected expense can be financially insurmountable. At a time when officials are urging the public to stay home when they fall ill, millions of people lack paid sick leave and can’t afford to miss work to care for themselves or a loved one. This puts many people at risk for being the vector of an illness that can prove deadly for the elderly and immunocompromised. And as businesses take precautions or are forced through social-distancing norms to close, the resulting loss of income for workers and owners will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and risk their housing, health, utility, and food security.

We must plan and act with the most vulnerable in mind to both stop the spread of this virus, and ensure that weeks and months of addressing this public health crisis don’t turn into years of economic hardship.

Specifically, we are calling on federal leaders to champion the following policies:

Pass a Paid Leave Policy for All Workers – Low-wage workers who cannot afford to lose a day's wages because of illness are less likely to seek medical care (for themselves and for their families) than workers who do have paid sick leave, and are 1.5 times more likely to go to work with contagious illnesses. This means that lack of paid sick leave is not only a problem for individual workers, but also a public health threat. Building on the House-passed version, a paid sick leave policy that covers all workers is urgently needed to address the new coronavirus outbreak and beyond to help protect the health and safety of the population.

Ensure Emergency Income During Work Disruptions – We need to provide guaranteed income to help those facing disruptions to their income due to lost opportunities, funding streams, or customers. This includes small business owners and their employees, community-serving nonprofits, freelancers and artists, and workers in a gig economy who are not eligible for unemployment benefits but still must make their rent or mortgage payments.

Place a Moratorium on All Evictions and Foreclosures and Ensure Housing Stability – We are in the midst of a housing crisis – We are in the midst of a housing crisis where 21 million renters and 17 million homeowners pay more than a third of their income on housing bills, making them extremely vulnerable to income disruptions. We need a moratorium on all evictions and foreclosures to prevent the economic fallout of the virus. We must also provide emergency housing vouchers for all unhoused people, and those facing eviction. And at a minimum, we need to stop displacing homeless encampments, and take measures to increase access to water, hand-washing stations, and sanitation at current encampments to support critical health outcomes.

Prevent Utility Shut-Offs and Restore Water Service to All Households – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. Over a third of US households are already at risk of inability to pay rising water bills. This is particularly concerning as washing our hands is our first line of defense against the virus. All public and private utilities should halt any utility shut-offs during this crisis, restore service to households currently experiencing a shutoff, and provide water delivery to all households with contaminated water systems.

Ensure Hospitals and Health-Care Centers Are Safe Places for Immigrants and Anyone Seeking Care – We must eliminate all barriers to people seeking proper medical attention, regardless of insurance or lack thereof. This also includes ensuring no one’s immigration status will be questioned when seeking assistance. Hospitals and health-care facilities must make it clear in all languages that immigration status will not be questioned, and should take steps to ensure immigration enforcement officials are not permitted in buildings.

Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 Through the Incarcerated Population – In the US, – In the US, 2.3 million people are exposed to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in prisons and jails, which will contribute to the spread of the coronavirus as the incarcerated population interacts with staff and other visitors. At a minimum, we must ensure incarcerated people have access to medical care and personal hygiene products; release elderly people with underlying medical problems to parole supervision; and release those who have an anticipated release date in 2020 and 2021 to parole supervision.

We are heartened by the swift actions that leaders in cities across the country are taking, proving once again that local leaders are national leaders. But we need policymakers at all levels to urgently address the threat of this current pandemic while ensuring we protect all struggling communities beyond this crisis.

Pass a Paid Leave Policy for All Workers – Low-wage workers who cannot afford to lose a day's wages because of illness are less likely to seek medical care (for themselves and for their families) than workers who do have paid sick leave, and are 1.5 times more likely to go to work with contagious illnesses. This means that lack of paid sick leave is not only a problem for individual workers, but also a public health threat. Building on the House-passed version, a paid sick leave policy that covers all workers is urgently needed to address the new coronavirus outbreak and beyond to help protect the health and safety of the population.

Ensure Emergency Income During Work Disruptions – We need to provide guaranteed income to help those facing disruptions to their income due to lost opportunities, funding streams, or customers. This includes small business owners and their employees, community-serving nonprofits, freelancers and artists, and workers in a gig economy who are not eligible for unemployment benefits but still must make their rent or mortgage payments.

Place a Moratorium on All Evictions and Foreclosures and Ensure Housing Stability – We are in the midst of a housing crisis – We are in the midst of a housing crisis where 21 million renters and 17 million homeowners pay more than a third of their income on housing bills, making them extremely vulnerable to income disruptions. We need a moratorium on all evictions and foreclosures to prevent the economic fallout of the virus. We must also provide emergency housing vouchers for all unhoused people, and those facing eviction. And at a minimum, we need to stop displacing homeless encampments, and take measures to increase access to water, hand-washing stations, and sanitation at current encampments to support critical health outcomes.

Prevent Utility Shut-Offs and Restore Water Service to All Households – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. Over a third of US households are already at risk of inability to pay rising water bills. This is particularly concerning as washing our hands is our first line of defense against the virus. All public and private utilities should halt any utility shut-offs during this crisis, restore service to households currently experiencing a shutoff, and provide water delivery to all households with contaminated water systems.

Ensure Hospitals and Health-Care Centers Are Safe Places for Immigrants and Anyone Seeking Care – We must eliminate all barriers to people seeking proper medical attention, regardless of insurance or lack thereof. This also includes ensuring no one’s immigration status will be questioned when seeking assistance. Hospitals and health-care facilities must make it clear in all languages that immigration status will not be questioned, and should take steps to ensure immigration enforcement officials are not permitted in buildings.

Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 Through the Incarcerated Population – In the US, – In the US, 2.3 million people are exposed to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in prisons and jails, which will contribute to the spread of the coronavirus as the incarcerated population interacts with staff and other visitors. At a minimum, we must ensure incarcerated people have access to medical care and personal hygiene products; release elderly people with underlying medical problems to parole supervision; and release those who have an anticipated release date in 2020 and 2021 to parole supervision.

We are heartened by the swift actions that leaders in cities across the country are taking, proving once again that local leaders are national leaders. But we need policymakers at all levels to urgently address the threat of this current pandemic while ensuring we protect all struggling communities beyond this crisis.

I have joined a club that is bigger than it should be and is certainly one that I definitely do not want to belong to. On Christmas Eve, my beautiful friend Sheila Green was murdered by her brother who suffered from psychosis. So now, I am one of the approximately 40% of Americans who know someone who was killed with a gun. That is an obscenely high number and is probably a low estimate as that study was done in 2015.

My wife, Sheryl, and I, met Sheila through mutual friends and through Sheryl’s work, when we first moved to Madison in 1985, as Sheila was an ultrasound tech at the same hospital where Sheryl did her medical residency. It was easy to become friends with Sheila as she had an ever present smile that always made you feel good when you saw her.

Sheila was also a chocolate aficionado, purchasing only the finest chocolates and baking up scrumptious chocolate treats on a regular basis. She was kind enough to share her flourless chocolate torte recipe with my wife, who has made countless of them over the years, and we think of Sheila every time we eat one. Sadly now, we will fondly remember her with each future torte.

Sheila came from a large family, and she was close with her many siblings. She did her best to care for her troubled brother. Sheila knew he owned a gun, and in fact, he had a concealed carry permit. She insisted that he not bring it to her home. For reasons we may never know, her brother did not honor that request on Christmas eve, and brought his gun to her home and shot and killed her.

Sheila’s friends and family are all grieving now for such a needless loss. It is especially needless because there are extreme risk protection laws in 17 states also known as red flag laws which are specifically designed to prevent murders by people who are known to be dangerous. These laws authorize courts to issue a protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others.

Usually, the request for the order will come from relatives or friends concerned about a loved one who owns one or more guns and has expressed suicidal thoughts or discussed shooting people. Wisconsin, however, is not one of those states. Yet, it could easily have had this law in place in time to protect Sheila from her brother, who was a known danger who legally possessed a gun.

This past October, Gov. Tony Evers called a special legislative session to consider two common sense gun control measures: universal background checks and red flag legislation. Despite the fact that 80% of Wisconsin residents support passage of these laws, Republican legislative leaders refused to vote on, or even debate these popular measures.

In an utter act of contempt for voters, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald dismissed the Senate in 30 seconds and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos dismissed the Assembly in 15 seconds. Gov. Evers has considered calling another special session on these measures, but thus far, has not done so.

One would like to believe that as society grows and learns, it improves. Yet, when it comes to gun control, the United States continues to behave as if there is nothing we can do to prevent gun violence, leaving our nation stuck in a warped 21st Century Wild, Wild West.

This is my tenth gun control post on my blog in seven years, and while sometimes I feel like giving up, I persist, because too many innocent lives are being snuffed out on a daily basis. Sadly, this time, she was a friend.

I grew up during the Vietnam War, and every Friday on the evening news, the anchorman would report the weekly body count of dead and wounded. My mother shared some wisdom with me at that time, that applies to every single gun death. She said that she wished that they did not publish the number of dead, because that made them anonymous and allowed people to forget that each life lost was a real human being with friends and family.

The same is true with America’s out of control gun violence. I will not add the gruesome statistics to this post because I want every reader to read Sheila Green’s name, look at her beautiful smiling face, that will smile no more — and then call or e-mail Robin Vos and Scott Fitzgerald and demand that they find some courage to pass a red flag law.

It is too late for Sheila, but it is not too late for the many lives who could be saved in the future.

I sincerely hope that the loss of Sheila’s life will gain some purpose if the Wisconsin legislature passes a red flag law. We could even call it Sheila’s Law.

"Sage has reportedly produced a paper suggesting 1.5 metres could be enough to minimise risk (Picture: AP/GETTY)

Senior Tory MPs are urging Boris Johnson to relax the two-metre rule to prevent job losses, it has been reported.

Concerns have been raised that parts of the hospitality industry won’t be able to get all staff back to work if the social distancing rule has to be observed.

Greg Clark, chair of the Commons Science Committee, told the Daily Telegraph he had written to Mr Johnson in favour of a new 1.5-metre rule that could save thousands from redundancy.

He said: ‘The difference between two metres and 1.5 metres may seem small but it can be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs.’

Mr Clark highlighted a paper from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) which he claimed indicated a ‘sharp’ fall in infection risk at 1.5 metres and does not appear to establish any need for a two-metre gap.

The paper said social distancing at less than two-metres can be workable in some areas provided workers stick to other virus control measures, he added.

Meanwhile, former Brexit secretary David Davis told the newspaper that the government should relax the two-metre rule as it dilutes the furlough scheme.

He warned many firms would have to remain shut due to the rule while the amount the government contributes to the furlough scheme starts to taper off.

Commons Science Committee chair Greg Clark said his recommendation was backed by research (Picture: AFP/GETTY IMAGES)

He said: ‘What will happen is that they will shut, meaning the furlough money is wasted, and there will be no tax revenue from that business’.

Not all countries recommend social distancing at two metres. In France, for example, the government urges citizens to stay ‘at least one metre’ away from others.

Experts heading up the government’s response to Covid stressed the importance of the current rules on Thursday, although they did highlight grey areas in the science of social distancing.

The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: ‘It’s not an absolute (that) beyond two metres is safe and slightly less is not safe, there’s a graduation across that, and so roughly at a metre it’s somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres.’

England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said that staying two metres apart when meeting someone outside would rule them out of being counted as a contact under the track & trace scheme – meaning one would not need to self-isolate if the other developed coronavirus.

Boris Johnson added: ‘I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.’

"Vijayan said all government offices in Kasaragod district would be closed for a week from tomorrow | PTI photo for representation

Twelve fresh cases of novel coronavirus were reported in Kerala on Friday, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 37, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.

While five cases were confirmed in Ernakulam, six were reported in Kasaragod and one case in Palakkad district, Vijayan told reporters after a COVID-19 review meeting here.

""Totally, 44,390 people are under observation, of which 44,165 are in home quarantine and 225 in isolation wards in hosiptals,"" he said.

Vijayan said all government offices in Kasaragod district would be closed for a week from tomorrow, while all places of worship and clubs will be shut.

Shops would remain open only from 11 am to 5 pm.

""We need to impose such restrictions in Kasaragod. We have issued an order. Two MLAs are under observation as they had come in contact with a positive case,"" he added.

Three positive cases had been treated and discharged from hospitals earlier.","The Minneapolis police officer accused of killing a handcuffed African American man was charged with murder Friday as authorities declared a curfew after three nights of violent protests left parts of the city in flames.

Derek Chauvin, the white officer filmed kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed George Floyd for nearly nine minutes, was charged with one count of third degree murder — unintentionally causing a death — and one count of negligent manslaughter.

“This case is now ready, and we have charged it,” said county prosecutor Mike Freeman amid outrage over the latest death of an African American in police custody.

Relatives of the 46-year-old Floyd — who spoke Friday with President Donald Trump — welcomed news of the arrest as a “step on the road to justice,” but said they hoped for tougher charges and action against the other officers involved in Floyd’s detention and death.

Freeman said the three other officers were also under investigation, and that he anticipated charges. All four officers were fired from the police department Tuesday after video surfaced of Monday’s arrest.

Troops deployed

The announcement of charges came hours after hundreds of troops were deployed to the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul to try to prevent a fourth night of violent protests.

Scores of buildings have been burned and looted across the so-called Twin Cities, including a police station associated with the four officers.

Mayor Jacob Frey declared a night-long curfew Friday and Saturday as protesters began to appear on the streets in Minneapolis and St. Paul again Friday afternoon.

Some chanted “I can’t breathe” — Floyd’s words as Chauvin’s knee pressed on his neck.

“We don’t care about this,” said one African-American demonstrator, indicating the burned-out buildings.

“If this is what it takes, we’re willing to do more. You’all were already killing us, when we weren’t doing anything. … Let’s hope it makes a change,” he told AFP, without giving his name.

Police were out in force in other cities as protests took place in other cities including New York, Washington, Atlanta, Houston and Portland, hoping to prevent recurrences of the violence that hit Minneapolis.

Charges criticized

Floyd’s family issued a statement acknowledging Chauvin’s arrest, but calling the charges against him insufficient.

“We want a first degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” they said in a statement.

“The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America.”

The third degree charge though reflected the official autopsy saying that even though Chauvin held his knee to Floyd’s neck for two minutes and 53 seconds after he became “non-responsive,” Floyd did not die of asphyxiation or strangulation.

“Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease,” the charging document said.

“The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions, and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.”

‘This shouldn’t be normal’

After beginning the day attacking the protesters as “thugs” and threatening to send in federal troops to deal harshly with them, Trump shifted tone later on Friday, announcing he had called Floyd’s family to express his “sorrow.”

“I understand the hurt, I understand the pain. People have really been through a lot. The family of George is entitled to justice and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said.

Former president Barack Obama said in a statement that he shared the “anguish” of millions of Americans over Floyd’s death.

“We have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal’,” he said. “This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America.”

Obama’s former vice president Joe Biden, who is running for president, also spoke to Floyd’s family.

He called for justice and said it was time to heal the “open wound” of systemic racism in the United States.",0.76757336

I have joined a club that is bigger than it should be and is certainly one that I definitely do not want to belong to. On Christmas Eve, my beautiful friend Sheila Green was murdered by her brother who suffered from psychosis. So now, I am one of the approximately 40% of Americans who know someone who was killed with a gun. That is an obscenely high number and is probably a low estimate as that study was done in 2015.

My wife, Sheryl, and I, met Sheila through mutual friends and through Sheryl’s work, when we first moved to Madison in 1985, as Sheila was an ultrasound tech at the same hospital where Sheryl did her medical residency. It was easy to become friends with Sheila as she had an ever present smile that always made you feel good when you saw her.

Sheila was also a chocolate aficionado, purchasing only the finest chocolates and baking up scrumptious chocolate treats on a regular basis. She was kind enough to share her flourless chocolate torte recipe with my wife, who has made countless of them over the years, and we think of Sheila every time we eat one. Sadly now, we will fondly remember her with each future torte.

Sheila came from a large family, and she was close with her many siblings. She did her best to care for her troubled brother. Sheila knew he owned a gun, and in fact, he had a concealed carry permit. She insisted that he not bring it to her home. For reasons we may never know, her brother did not honor that request on Christmas eve, and brought his gun to her home and shot and killed her.

Sheila’s friends and family are all grieving now for such a needless loss. It is especially needless because there are extreme risk protection laws in 17 states also known as red flag laws which are specifically designed to prevent murders by people who are known to be dangerous. These laws authorize courts to issue a protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others.

Usually, the request for the order will come from relatives or friends concerned about a loved one who owns one or more guns and has expressed suicidal thoughts or discussed shooting people. Wisconsin, however, is not one of those states. Yet, it could easily have had this law in place in time to protect Sheila from her brother, who was a known danger who legally possessed a gun.

This past October, Gov. Tony Evers called a special legislative session to consider two common sense gun control measures: universal background checks and red flag legislation. Despite the fact that 80% of Wisconsin residents support passage of these laws, Republican legislative leaders refused to vote on, or even debate these popular measures.

In an utter act of contempt for voters, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald dismissed the Senate in 30 seconds and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos dismissed the Assembly in 15 seconds. Gov. Evers has considered calling another special session on these measures, but thus far, has not done so.

One would like to believe that as society grows and learns, it improves. Yet, when it comes to gun control, the United States continues to behave as if there is nothing we can do to prevent gun violence, leaving our nation stuck in a warped 21st Century Wild, Wild West.

This is my tenth gun control post on my blog in seven years, and while sometimes I feel like giving up, I persist, because too many innocent lives are being snuffed out on a daily basis. Sadly, this time, she was a friend.

I grew up during the Vietnam War, and every Friday on the evening news, the anchorman would report the weekly body count of dead and wounded. My mother shared some wisdom with me at that time, that applies to every single gun death. She said that she wished that they did not publish the number of dead, because that made them anonymous and allowed people to forget that each life lost was a real human being with friends and family.

The same is true with America’s out of control gun violence. I will not add the gruesome statistics to this post because I want every reader to read Sheila Green’s name, look at her beautiful smiling face, that will smile no more — and then call or e-mail Robin Vos and Scott Fitzgerald and demand that they find some courage to pass a red flag law.

It is too late for Sheila, but it is not too late for the many lives who could be saved in the future.

I sincerely hope that the loss of Sheila’s life will gain some purpose if the Wisconsin legislature passes a red flag law. We could even call it Sheila’s Law.

Cuomo, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, and Delaware Governor John Carney today announced a multi-state agreement to reopen public and private beaches with certain restrictions in place effective, Friday, May 22. This approach will better align the states' policies ahead of the summer months.

""With Memorial Day weekend fast approaching and warmer weather on the way, we want to make sure New Yorkers and residents of our neighboring states are able to safely enjoy outdoor recreational activities,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""We have been coordinating with other states throughout this entire pandemic, and we have worked on an agreement allowing beaches to be open with proper social distancing and other public health protections in place so we can begin establishing a new normal without jeopardizing the progress we've already made.""

Governor Murphy said, ""A trip to the beach is a treasured past time for New Jerseyans on Memorial Day weekend just as it is for residents in our neighboring states. By aligning our social distancing policies for beaches, we can bring some semblance of a 'new normal' to our region ahead of the first weekend of the summer season.""

Governor Lamont said, ""Our beaches are some of our most beautiful and treasured assets. We want to make sure they are enjoyed up and down the East Coast in the safest possible way, especially as the Summer Season begins. Working together as states to make sure they can be enjoyed responsibly makes sense.""

Governor Carney said, ""Summer at the beach is a huge part of life for so many Delawareans. As we ease our way into a new normal, we're trying to find ways for Delawareans to safely to enjoy the outdoors and the company of their families.""",0.785921

"Sage has reportedly produced a paper suggesting 1.5 metres could be enough to minimise risk (Picture: AP/GETTY)

Senior Tory MPs are urging Boris Johnson to relax the two-metre rule to prevent job losses, it has been reported.

Concerns have been raised that parts of the hospitality industry won’t be able to get all staff back to work if the social distancing rule has to be observed.

Greg Clark, chair of the Commons Science Committee, told the Daily Telegraph he had written to Mr Johnson in favour of a new 1.5-metre rule that could save thousands from redundancy.

He said: ‘The difference between two metres and 1.5 metres may seem small but it can be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs.’

Mr Clark highlighted a paper from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) which he claimed indicated a ‘sharp’ fall in infection risk at 1.5 metres and does not appear to establish any need for a two-metre gap.

The paper said social distancing at less than two-metres can be workable in some areas provided workers stick to other virus control measures, he added.

Meanwhile, former Brexit secretary David Davis told the newspaper that the government should relax the two-metre rule as it dilutes the furlough scheme.

He warned many firms would have to remain shut due to the rule while the amount the government contributes to the furlough scheme starts to taper off.

Commons Science Committee chair Greg Clark said his recommendation was backed by research (Picture: AFP/GETTY IMAGES)

He said: ‘What will happen is that they will shut, meaning the furlough money is wasted, and there will be no tax revenue from that business’.

Not all countries recommend social distancing at two metres. In France, for example, the government urges citizens to stay ‘at least one metre’ away from others.

Experts heading up the government’s response to Covid stressed the importance of the current rules on Thursday, although they did highlight grey areas in the science of social distancing.

The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: ‘It’s not an absolute (that) beyond two metres is safe and slightly less is not safe, there’s a graduation across that, and so roughly at a metre it’s somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres.’

England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said that staying two metres apart when meeting someone outside would rule them out of being counted as a contact under the track & trace scheme – meaning one would not need to self-isolate if the other developed coronavirus.

Boris Johnson added: ‘I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.’

The Chancellor tonight said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, will cover 80 per cent of a self-employed person's average monthly profits.

But it may not be available until June and will only be available to those who have a tax return for 2019, meaning the newly self-employed will be ineligible.

And Mr Sunak warned that the self-employed could face tax hikes in the future as part of the effort to ""right the ship"" and repair the battered public finances after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Details of the scheme came as the Department of Health announced a total of 578 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK have died as of 5pm on March 25.

Some 11,658 people have tested positive in the UK as of 9am on March 26.

Mr Sunak's scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

To qualify, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.

Up to 3.8 million people will qualify for support, with average monthly payments expected to be £940 per person.

Mr Sunak said the scheme, which will last for at least three months, ""is one of the most generous in the world"".

""It targets support to those who need help most, offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work.""

He said the measure covers 95 per cent of people who receive the majority of their income from self-employment.

But in a hint that the self-employed could be asked to pay more to the taxman in future he said it was ""now much harder to justify"" the tax breaks on offer to the self-employed if they were receiving the same level of state support.

He said everyone would be ""chipping in together to right the ship afterwards"" once the crisis is over.

A number of self-employed workers welcomed the Chancellor's measures but expressed concern about having to wait until June to claim.

Louise Barina, a production manager who lives in London, said: ""After having spoken to our landlord, he has outright said no, that we can't get a delay on our rent.

""In terms of the payment coming in June, that's really problematic for us as that's obviously three months of payment where we need to find the money for that.""

Meanwhile the Department of Health said revising its reporting approach for coronavirus deaths ""to ensure data can be verified and published in a timely, consistent way"".

A statement on Twitter said: ""Figures issued today are recorded as of 5pm on March 24 to 5pm on March 25.

""Going forwards, figures on deaths will be recorded for the 24-hour period as of 5pm the previous day. Figures on tests remain as of the 24-hour period from 9am that day.""",0.8504158
