"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",A group of boys are playing soccer on the beach.,0.39272928

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",A group of boys are playing soccer on the beach.,0.4104192

a dog splashing in the water .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",a dog splashing in the water .,0.42773986

Two boys are playing flag football.,"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",0.42809373

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",0.42883453

A woman in a black and orange jacket throws a stick for a brown and black dog to fetch.,"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",0.4319257
a girl in a red shirt is riding a brown horse .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

"By Express News Service

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",Two women walk down the sidewalk in the afternoon.,0.43279305

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",0.43374753

"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",A group of boys are playing soccer on the beach.,0.4343806

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter.

a white dog runs along a rocky shoreline .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

a small black and white dog is swimming in water .,"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",0.43601167

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter.

A woman is swimming underwater.,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

A woman is playing the guitar.,"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",0.45079058

A woman is playing the guitar.,"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",0.45306066

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",A baby is playing a guitar,0.45558384
a woman plays with a brown dog .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",0.45972246

"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.",A white dog is standing on a grassy hillside,0.4620964

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

a boy and a girl playing on the beach .,"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.46567595

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

One boy is happily playing a piano,"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",0.4699542

a woman is slicing fish .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

A man is playing drums.,"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",a dog splashing in the water .,0.4747113
"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",0.47768658

Two dogs are cheerfully playing together on the grass,"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",0.47947472

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.",the black and white cat is looking up at the camera .,0.4806968
A girl is brushing her hair.,"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.4812781

a man is carving a statue .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",a dog and cat laying down together .,0.4854739
"Brunette bombshell Ana Cheri knows how to get the attention of her 12.4 million followers. Most of the time that involves baring lots of skin. In her latest Instagram update, the beauty teased fans by giving them a flash of cleavage when she unzipped her workout bra in a flirty video.

Ana's clip showed her modeling several workout bras and a pair of yoga pants from her clothing line, Cheri Fit. The video captured her body from her hips up as she stood near a wall covered with floral wallpaper.

The first portion of the video proved to be the most sexy as she lowered the zipper on her black bra while flashing a smile at the camera. Before the zipper came undone, she quickly closed it up. She then lifted her hair, spun around, and gave followers a look at the back of the bra. Ana swayed her hips back and forth before the clip jumped to her wearing a different bra. It showed her backside for a few seconds before she turned around and faced the front.

The video continued in the same fashion, showing the beauty in a variety of bras in colors that included red and pink. All of them showed off her cleavage and hourglass shape as she struck several coy poses. At one point in the clip, she playfully held a rose and waved it at the camera. The clip ended showing Ana wearing a pink, long-sleeved crop top.

As for makeup, Ana's eyes were framed with dark brows, smoky eye shadow and thick lashes. She also wore a rose gloss on her lips.

In the caption, she announced that Cheri Fit was having a sale on tops for Valentine's Day.

Many of her fans wished her a happy holiday, while others showered her with compliments.

""Wow your [sic] just so beautiful,"" one admirer told her.

""Absolutely gorgeous in every way,"" said a second follower.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

The boy is riding a bike on the top of a fence made of metal,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

A man is passionately playing a guitar,"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.49143755

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter.

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",A woman is chopping a red onion,0.49384028

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

A woman is chopping a red onion,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",A dog is jumping in the shade of some trees,0.4986433

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

A man is eating a bowl of cereal,"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",the man is kissing and hugging the woman .,0.5004237
"Brunette bombshell Ana Cheri knows how to get the attention of her 12.4 million followers. Most of the time that involves baring lots of skin. In her latest Instagram update, the beauty teased fans by giving them a flash of cleavage when she unzipped her workout bra in a flirty video.

Ana's clip showed her modeling several workout bras and a pair of yoga pants from her clothing line, Cheri Fit. The video captured her body from her hips up as she stood near a wall covered with floral wallpaper.

The first portion of the video proved to be the most sexy as she lowered the zipper on her black bra while flashing a smile at the camera. Before the zipper came undone, she quickly closed it up. She then lifted her hair, spun around, and gave followers a look at the back of the bra. Ana swayed her hips back and forth before the clip jumped to her wearing a different bra. It showed her backside for a few seconds before she turned around and faced the front.

The video continued in the same fashion, showing the beauty in a variety of bras in colors that included red and pink. All of them showed off her cleavage and hourglass shape as she struck several coy poses. At one point in the clip, she playfully held a rose and waved it at the camera. The clip ended showing Ana wearing a pink, long-sleeved crop top.

As for makeup, Ana's eyes were framed with dark brows, smoky eye shadow and thick lashes. She also wore a rose gloss on her lips.

In the caption, she announced that Cheri Fit was having a sale on tops for Valentine's Day.

Many of her fans wished her a happy holiday, while others showered her with compliments.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year.

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

A young girl is looking at a woman in costume,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

A man is frying a tortilla,"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",0.5153754

"Brunette bombshell Ana Cheri knows how to get the attention of her 12.4 million followers. Most of the time that involves baring lots of skin. In her latest Instagram update, the beauty teased fans by giving them a flash of cleavage when she unzipped her workout bra in a flirty video.

Ana's clip showed her modeling several workout bras and a pair of yoga pants from her clothing line, Cheri Fit. The video captured her body from her hips up as she stood near a wall covered with floral wallpaper.

The first portion of the video proved to be the most sexy as she lowered the zipper on her black bra while flashing a smile at the camera. Before the zipper came undone, she quickly closed it up. She then lifted her hair, spun around, and gave followers a look at the back of the bra. Ana swayed her hips back and forth before the clip jumped to her wearing a different bra. It showed her backside for a few seconds before she turned around and faced the front.

The video continued in the same fashion, showing the beauty in a variety of bras in colors that included red and pink. All of them showed off her cleavage and hourglass shape as she struck several coy poses. At one point in the clip, she playfully held a rose and waved it at the camera. The clip ended showing Ana wearing a pink, long-sleeved crop top.

As for makeup, Ana's eyes were framed with dark brows, smoky eye shadow and thick lashes. She also wore a rose gloss on her lips.

In the caption, she announced that Cheri Fit was having a sale on tops for Valentine's Day.

Many of her fans wished her a happy holiday, while others showered her with compliments.

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",0.5207638
black and white cows behind a fence .,"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",0.52135897
"KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

some people are singing .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

"Brunette bombshell Ana Cheri knows how to get the attention of her 12.4 million followers. Most of the time that involves baring lots of skin. In her latest Instagram update, the beauty teased fans by giving them a flash of cleavage when she unzipped her workout bra in a flirty video.

Ana's clip showed her modeling several workout bras and a pair of yoga pants from her clothing line, Cheri Fit. The video captured her body from her hips up as she stood near a wall covered with floral wallpaper.

The first portion of the video proved to be the most sexy as she lowered the zipper on her black bra while flashing a smile at the camera. Before the zipper came undone, she quickly closed it up. She then lifted her hair, spun around, and gave followers a look at the back of the bra. Ana swayed her hips back and forth before the clip jumped to her wearing a different bra. It showed her backside for a few seconds before she turned around and faced the front.

The video continued in the same fashion, showing the beauty in a variety of bras in colors that included red and pink. All of them showed off her cleavage and hourglass shape as she struck several coy poses. At one point in the clip, she playfully held a rose and waved it at the camera. The clip ended showing Ana wearing a pink, long-sleeved crop top.

As for makeup, Ana's eyes were framed with dark brows, smoky eye shadow and thick lashes. She also wore a rose gloss on her lips.

In the caption, she announced that Cheri Fit was having a sale on tops for Valentine's Day.

Many of her fans wished her a happy holiday, while others showered her with compliments.

A horse is not racing,"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.53392214

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

RULES TO TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER

1. Make your bed every day, even if it’s right before you get in it.

2. Don’t wear holey underwear…in case you’re in an accident and they cut your clothes off.

3. Travel light through life. Keep only what you need.

4. It’s okay to cry when you’re hurt. It’s also okay to smash (some) things; but, wash your face, clean your mess, and get up off the floor when you’re done. You don’t belong down there.

5. If you’re going to curse, be clever. If you’re going to curse in public, know your audience.

6. Seek out the people and places that resonate with your soul.

7. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.

8. 5-second rule. It’s just dirt. There are worse things in a fast food cheeseburger.

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",0.5536656

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.",be affected with smut or mildew,0.5560577

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has announced that it has produced its one millionth electric car, thus becoming the first auto manufacturer to reach the milestone. It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car — a red Model Y — on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it’s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.

In its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla’s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works — building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.

Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original “fall 2020” estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla’s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report.

The company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It’s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year.

"Hangovers are a multifactorial equation that may be a little hard to understand, but the solution is always the same: misery. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.","greenspan told congress on tuesday the u.s. economy "" could very well be embarking on a period of sustained growth "" .",0.5835822

Since the age of 10 Sam Willis knew he wanted to be a paramedic but he never imagined he would become a successful lecturer, author, editor teaching paramedicine in two countries. The English born and raised senior lecturer has now been in Port Macquarie over a year and said he loves what he does. ""When I was about 10 I witnessed a car crash and watching the paramedics work I knew that was what I wanted to do when I grew up,"" Sam said. ""The paramedics I saw that day instinctively knew what to do and I thought they had all the answers to help the people who were hurt and I knew then I wanted to do the same thing when I got older. ""It hasn't always been an easy path to get where I wanted to go but I believe with passion and determination then you can get there. ""When I started as a paramedic in England I never thought I would go on to teach at universities in two countries or be an author but that is my life."" Mr Willis is a senior lecturer in paramedicine at Charles Sturt University based in Port macquarie, Mr Willis has a masters degree and is currently working towards a PhD in paramedicine, and said growing up his life wasn't easy but with a goal of where he wanted to end up his passion and drive got him there. ""I didn't get the marks at school to go and study what I wanted to right away so I had to go to college before going to university,"" he said. ""It wasn't easy and I had to make a lot of sacrifices but knowing what I wanted made it worth it. In the beginning I worked as an ambulance dispatcher and i didn't get into paramedicine the first time so it was challenging. ""I did question what I wanted and if it really was what I wanted but deep down I knew it was."" As a lecturer Mr Willis said he does sympathise with students who are struggling and prides himself on trying to help them. ""When I was studying the course was challenging which did make it hard at times but I am a big believer in even if something is hard you should go for it."" Mr Willis is the co-author and a contributor to a second edition of Fundamentals of Paramedic Practice, an accessible and comprehensive introduction to paramedic science and pre-hospital care, providing expert and up-to-date guidance on the essential theories and real-world practice of this dynamic area of emergency medicine. ""The book came about because there aren't a lot of new books coming about about paramedicine and I wanted to change that. ""The book has a large number of fantastic contributors who have ensured the book is relevant and up to date."" The book is being launch at Charles Sturt University in Port Macquarie on March 10.

"Brunette bombshell Ana Cheri knows how to get the attention of her 12.4 million followers. Most of the time that involves baring lots of skin. In her latest Instagram update, the beauty teased fans by giving them a flash of cleavage when she unzipped her workout bra in a flirty video.

Ana's clip showed her modeling several workout bras and a pair of yoga pants from her clothing line, Cheri Fit. The video captured her body from her hips up as she stood near a wall covered with floral wallpaper.

The first portion of the video proved to be the most sexy as she lowered the zipper on her black bra while flashing a smile at the camera. Before the zipper came undone, she quickly closed it up. She then lifted her hair, spun around, and gave followers a look at the back of the bra. Ana swayed her hips back and forth before the clip jumped to her wearing a different bra. It showed her backside for a few seconds before she turned around and faced the front.

The video continued in the same fashion, showing the beauty in a variety of bras in colors that included red and pink. All of them showed off her cleavage and hourglass shape as she struck several coy poses. At one point in the clip, she playfully held a rose and waved it at the camera. The clip ended showing Ana wearing a pink, long-sleeved crop top.

As for makeup, Ana's eyes were framed with dark brows, smoky eye shadow and thick lashes. She also wore a rose gloss on her lips.

In the caption, she announced that Cheri Fit was having a sale on tops for Valentine's Day.

Many of her fans wished her a happy holiday, while others showered her with compliments.

""Wow your [sic] just so beautiful,"" one admirer told her.

""Absolutely gorgeous in every way,"" said a second follower.

LIMBA MUPETAMI







Belgian cyclist Victor Campenaerts and Michelle Vorster made easy work of the Nedbank Cycle Challenge in Windhoek yesterday.



Campaenaerts broke away early from the rest of the pack to win in a time of 2 hours, 11 minutes and 35 seconds.



Namibian cyclist Dan Craven beat Martin Freyer in the sprint for second place in a time of 2 hours, 19 minutes. The cyclist said he knew that he was going to win and thus cycled on his pace without any real threat from the rest of the contenders.



Right after the race Campenaerts said he would donate his N$12 000 winnings to the organisation Physically Active Youth (PAY), which he visited last week.



He said he was impressed with the work they are doing and knew from the start that he had to win the race in order to give them the money.



Craven and Freyer also announced at the prize-giving that they would donate their N$9 000 and N$6 000 winnings to the same organisation, which is an after-school centre in Katutura that provides a safe and nurturing learning environment for youngsters from disadvantaged communities.



The women’s 100 km race was easily won by Michelle Vorster (2 hours, 39 minutes, 31 seconds), who also on Saturday won the Nedbank Mountain Bike Challenge.



In second place was Imke Jagau (2 hours, 44 minutes and 55 seconds), and in third was Risa Dreyer. Their winnings are the same as the men’s.",0.68528765
