LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

While HDFC Bank, IndusIndia Bank, RIL, Tata, SBI gained, leading tech stocks were trading in the red.

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex rebounded nearly 500 points in opening session on Tuesday as global investors calmed on no further escalation in the mid-east tensions.

a dog is riding on a bicyclists shoulders .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

A bicycle is being ridden by the little boy in a race,"Debaucherous evening last night? You’re probably dealing with veisalgia right now.

More commonly known as a hangover, this unpleasant phenomenon has been dogging humanity since our ancestors first happened upon fermentation.

Those nasty vertigo-inducing, cold sweat-promoting and vomit-producing sensations after a raucous night out are all part of your body’s attempt to protect itself from injury after you overindulge in alcoholic beverages. Your liver is working to break down the alcohol you consumed so your kidneys can clear it out ASAP. But in the process, your body’s inflammatory and metabolic reactions are going to lay you low with a hangover.

Advertisement:

As long as people have suffered from hangovers, they’ve searched in vain for a cure. Revelers have access to a variety of compounds, products and devices that purport to ease the pain. But there’s a lot of purporting and not a lot of proof. Most have not been backed up well by science in terms of usefulness for hangover treatment, and often their effects don’t seem like they’d match up with what scientists know about the biology of the hangover.

Working overtime to clear out the booze

Hangovers are virtually guaranteed when you drink too much. That amount varies from person to person based on genetic factors as well as whether there are other compounds that formed along with ethanol in the fermentation process.

Advertisement:

Over the course of a night of heavy drinking, your blood alcohol level continues to rise. Your body labors to break down the alcohol — consumed as ethanol in beer, wine or spirits — forming damaging oxygen free radicals and acetaldehyde, itself a harmful compound. The longer ethanol and acetaldehyde stick around, the more damage they can do to your cellular membranes, proteins and DNA, so your body’s enzymes work quickly to metabolize acetaldehyde to a less toxic compound, acetate.

Over time, your ethanol levels drop through this natural metabolic process. Depending on how much you consumed, you’re likely to experience a hangover as the level of ethanol in your blood slowly returns to zero. Your body is withdrawing from high levels of circulating alcohol, while at the same time trying to protect itself from the effects of alcohol.

Scientists have limited knowledge of the leading causes of the hangover. But they do know that the body’s responses include changes in hormone levels to reduce dehydration and cellular stress. Alcohol consumption also affects a variety of neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including glutamate, dopamine and serotonin. Inflammation increases in the body’s tissues, and the healthy gut bacteria in your digestive system take a hit too, promoting leaky gut.

Advertisement:

Altogether, the combination of all these reactions and protective mechanisms activated by your system gives rise to the experience of a hangover, which can last up to 48 hours.

Your misery likely has company

Drinking and socializing are cultural acts, and most hangovers do not happen in isolation. Human beings are social creatures, and there’s a high likelihood that at least one other individual feels the same as you the morning after the night before.

Advertisement:

Each society has different rules regarding alcohol use, which can affect how people view alcohol consumption within those cultures. Drinking is often valued for its relaxing effect and for promoting sociability. So it’s common to see alcohol provided at celebratory events, social gatherings and holiday parties.

In the United States, drinking alcohol is largely embraced by mainstream culture, which may even promote behaviors involving excessive drinking. It should be no surprise that overindulgence goes hand in hand with these celebratory social events — and leads to hangover regrets a few hours later.

Your body’s reactions to high alcohol intake and the sobering-up period can influence mood, too. The combination of fatigue that you experience from sleep deprivation and hormonal stress reactions, in turn, affect your neurobiological responses and behavior. As your body is attempting to repair itself, you’re more likely to be easily irritated, exhausted and want nothing more than to be left alone. Of course, your work productivity takes a dramatic hit the day after an evening of heavy drinking.

Advertisement:

When all is said and done, you’re the cause of your own hangover pain, and you’re the one who must pay for all the fun of the night before. But in short order, you’ll forget how excruciating your last hangover was. And you may very soon talk yourself into doing the things you swore you’d never do again.

Speeding up recovery

While pharmacologists like us understand a bit about how hangovers work, we still lack a true remedy.

Advertisement:

Countless articles describe a variety of foods, caffeine, ion replenishment, energy drinks, herbal supplements including thyme and ginger, vitamins and the “hair of the dog” as ways to prevent and treat hangovers. But the evidence isn’t really there that any of these work effectively. They’re just not scientifically validated or well reproduced.

For example, Kudzu root (Pueraria lobata), a popular choice for hangover remedies, has primarily been investigated for its effects in reducing alcohol-mediated stress and hangover. But at the same time, Kudzu root appears to inhibit the enzymes that break down acetaldehyde — not good news since you want to clear that acetaldehyde from your system quickly.

To fill this knowledge gap, our lab is working with colleagues to see if we can find scientific evidence for or against potential hangover remedies. We’ve focused on the benefits of dihydromyricetin, a Chinese herbal medicine that is currently available and formulated as a dietary supplement for hangover reduction or prevention.

Dihydromyricetin appears to work its magic by enhancing alcohol metabolism and reducing its toxic byproduct, acetaldehyde. From our findings in mice models, we are collecting data that support the usefulness of dihydromyricetin in increasing the expression and activity of enzymes responsible for ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism in the liver, where ethanol is primarily broken down. These findings explain one of the several ways dihydromyricetin protects the body against alcohol stress and hangover symptoms.

Advertisement:

We are also studying how this enhancement of alcohol metabolism results in changes in alcohol drinking behaviors. Previously, dihydromyricetin was found to counteract the relaxation affect of drinking alcohol by interfering with particular neuroreceptors in the brain; rodents didn’t become as intoxicated and consequently reduced their ethanol intake. Through this combination of mechanisms, we hope to illustrate how DHM might reduce the downsides of excessive drinking beyond the temporary hangover, and potentially reduce drinking behavior and damage associated with heavy alcohol consumption.

Of course, limiting alcohol intake and substituting water for many of those drinks during an evening out is probably the best method to avoid a painful hangover. However, for those times when one alcoholic beverage leads to more than a few more, be sure to stay hydrated and catch up on rest. Your best bet for a smoother recovery is probably some combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen, Netflix and a little downtime.

While HDFC Bank, IndusIndia Bank, RIL, Tata, SBI gained, leading tech stocks were trading in the red.

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex rebounded nearly 500 points in opening session on Tuesday as global investors calmed on no further escalation in the mid-east tensions.

After hitting a high of 41,135.47, the 30-share BSE index was trading 450 points or 1.11 per cent higher at 41,126.63. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rallied 132.25 points or 1.10 per cent to 12,125.30.

HDFC Bank was the gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying up to 2.16 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, Relinace Industries, Tata Steel, SBI and Axis Bank.

On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech were trading in the red.

In the previous session, the 30-share gauge ended at 40,676.63, dropping of 787.98 points, or 1.90 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty closed at 11,993.05, falling by 233.60 points, or 1.91 per cent.

Meanwhile, on a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 103.84 crore, and domestic institutional investors offloaded shares worth Rs 23.70 crore on Monday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

According to traders, domestic investors followed Asian stocks that rebounded after a day of no escalation in the US-Iran tussle.

The Pentagon on Monday distanced itself from U.S. President Donald Trump’s assertions that he would bomb Iranian cultural sites despite international prohibitions on such attacks.

Following the news, Brent crude futures fell 1.20 per cent to USD 68.08.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul were trading in the green.

a bird is flapping its wings in the water .,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

While HDFC Bank, IndusIndia Bank, RIL, Tata, SBI gained, leading tech stocks were trading in the red.

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex rebounded nearly 500 points in opening session on Tuesday as global investors calmed on no further escalation in the mid-east tensions.

HDFC Bank was the gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying up to 2.16 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, Relinace Industries, Tata Steel, SBI and Axis Bank.

On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech were trading in the red.
