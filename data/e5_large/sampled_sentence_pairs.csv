A baby is playing with a doll,"Sustainable fisheries plan for Caribbean Netherlands

A means of existence under threat.

BONAIRE--A 2019 policy brief was just released, outlining requirements for sustainably managing fisheries within the Caribbean Netherlands. Using five different studies, a four-phase roadmap was created to bring local stakeholders and government legislators together to secure the future of local fish stocks.

Without action, a collapse of important fish species could be right around the corner, stated the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance (DCNA).

“Maintaining healthy coral reef and fish populations is fundamental in sustaining both the traditional way of life and ever-increasing tourism throughout the Caribbean. Although fisheries within this region are better managed today than they were in previous decades, the Caribbean is still facing an overall decrease in fish stocks.

“Managing the remaining fish populations requires balancing local cultural traditions with the reality of today's environmental conditions. Therefore, this must be a collaborative effort between residents, local and national governments, NGOs and buyers.”

According to the release, to better define the challenges and needs of local fisheries five different studies were conducted on historical fisheries, market analyses, communication and awareness, social mapping and co-management. The goal was to provide insight into how these local fisheries can be improved and sustained for years to come.

Although the final outcome of two of these studies are not yet available, preliminary results have been released to support the upcoming Sustainable Fisheries Plan by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality LNV. Mac & Field consultants, in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) NL, used these to produce a policy brief to help in the creation of the Sustainable Fisheries Plan.

A common finding throughout each of these studies was that sustainable fishing practices are mostly lacking throughout the Caribbean Netherlands. This has led to an overexploitation or full exploitation of almost all commercial fish stocks.

Although the Ministry of LNV is responsible for fisheries management, implementation and regulation is not possible without the support from all stakeholders. This requires that enough resources are dedicated to this process (e.g. fisheries staff and budget within the local public entities) and open communication between stakeholders providing a feedback loop to meet the evolving needs of each island.

“Emphasising a co-management approach ensures the unique needs and desires of local stakeholders are considered in the design and implementation of a Sustainable Fisheries Management Plan. Fishermen must be included throughout each step of this process to maximise the likelihood that these regulations are implemented and complied with. Furthermore, new and non-traditional fishing activities (such as foreign fishing operations) should be considered within the management plan as well,” added DCNA.

“If left unmanaged, a collapse of certain local fish species is likely. As fish stocks continue to decrease, local and foreign demand continues to increase while coral reefs essential for healthy fisheries continue to decline. By working together, a truly Sustainable Fisheries Management Plan can and should be created and implemented ensuring fish stocks are available to local fishermen for many years to come.”",0.572437

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

A means of existence under threat.

BONAIRE--A 2019 policy brief was just released, outlining requirements for sustainably managing fisheries within the Caribbean Netherlands. Using five different studies, a four-phase roadmap was created to bring local stakeholders and government legislators together to secure the future of local fish stocks.

Without action, a collapse of important fish species could be right around the corner, stated the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance (DCNA).

“Maintaining healthy coral reef and fish populations is fundamental in sustaining both the traditional way of life and ever-increasing tourism throughout the Caribbean. Although fisheries within this region are better managed today than they were in previous decades, the Caribbean is still facing an overall decrease in fish stocks.

“Managing the remaining fish populations requires balancing local cultural traditions with the reality of today's environmental conditions. Therefore, this must be a collaborative effort between residents, local and national governments, NGOs and buyers.”

According to the release, to better define the challenges and needs of local fisheries five different studies were conducted on historical fisheries, market analyses, communication and awareness, social mapping and co-management. The goal was to provide insight into how these local fisheries can be improved and sustained for years to come.

Although the final outcome of two of these studies are not yet available, preliminary results have been released to support the upcoming Sustainable Fisheries Plan by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality LNV. Mac & Field consultants, in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) NL, used these to produce a policy brief to help in the creation of the Sustainable Fisheries Plan.

A common finding throughout each of these studies was that sustainable fishing practices are mostly lacking throughout the Caribbean Netherlands. This has led to an overexploitation or full exploitation of almost all commercial fish stocks.

Although the Ministry of LNV is responsible for fisheries management, implementation and regulation is not possible without the support from all stakeholders. This requires that enough resources are dedicated to this process (e.g. fisheries staff and budget within the local public entities) and open communication between stakeholders providing a feedback loop to meet the evolving needs of each island.

“Emphasising a co-management approach ensures the unique needs and desires of local stakeholders are considered in the design and implementation of a Sustainable Fisheries Management Plan. Fishermen must be included throughout each step of this process to maximise the likelihood that these regulations are implemented and complied with. Furthermore, new and non-traditional fishing activities (such as foreign fishing operations) should be considered within the management plan as well,” added DCNA.

“If left unmanaged, a collapse of certain local fish species is likely. As fish stocks continue to decrease, local and foreign demand continues to increase while coral reefs essential for healthy fisheries continue to decline. By working together, a truly Sustainable Fisheries Management Plan can and should be created and implemented ensuring fish stocks are available to local fishermen for many years to come.”",0.632636

"NEW DELHI: The restrictions imposed by the army on its personnel and formations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is posing challenges to its internal functioning.Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties. While this is also affecting the training routines of troops, reduction in attendance at the headquarters is set to slow down other work as well, said officials.The steps are aimed at ensuring social distancing and preventing contagion. It has created an unprecedented situation, forcing the army to improvise, especially because troops eat, sleep and train together within confined spaces. For example, one particular unit has now divided troops into teams that live in different areas, while ensuring that only one team uses the common toilets at a time. Training is conducted in small batches, and the equipment is sanitised every time it is used.The army on Monday issued fresh instructions to all its military stations, cantonments, units and formations in the 82 districts under lockdown. These include restricted movements, functioning of only those personnel engaged in essential services and the closure of all CSD canteens Officials said the reduction in manpower in some of the army’s formations was due to the extension of leave of soldiers till April 15 and placing those who recently returned on quarantine. Those who are going on leave due to an emergency in their families will be sent for a minimum period of 30 days. “We are in a situation where we are slightly less in strength. It affects day-to-day functioning, administrative and security duties. There is an increase in the workload of those on guard duties, because there is less turnover of troops,” an official said.The manpower also gets affected because troops are tasked with manning the quarantine facilities setup by the army. However, officials said the situation was not “alarming”, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army’s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept. Last week, the army passed instructions that 35% officers and 50% junior commissioned officers (JCO) and other ranks (OR) would work from home for a week from Monday, while the next group would do this starting March 30. The lockdown in Delhi is also affecting the travel of those personnel who stay in Gurgaon and Uttar Pradesh.“Work at the headquarters has slowed, as we are working with bare essentials. The deadline for work such as submitting reports will be extended. Only emergency work will continue as it was,” an official said.The army’s complaints section for now will only be dealing with cases that are urgent. Officials said rosters had been created to divide the staff between those who work at home and those who come to the office. However, it remains to be seen what work will be given to those working from home, because files cannot be taken home due to confidentiality issues. Several issues also cannot be communicated over email due to cybersecurity threats. Moreover, JCOs and ORs are mainly clerks who are part of the filing system for letters and documents, which can be done only from the offices.Officials said training of troops had also reduced. However, this will not affect operational preparedness, because it is for a short duration and can be made up later.In relation to the unit mentioned earlier, training of troops has become more “concentrated”, because smaller batches are being trained. “This has given us an opportunity to train better. Training small groups ensures that everyone’s doubts are cleared and attention is given to each aspect. But due to the pandemic, we have to sanitise an equipment every time it is used,” an official said.This type of training comes after troops were divided into small teams that maintained a distance of 200 metre between each other. It is also being ensured that distances are being maintained between troops of a team. “Only one team can use a bathroom at a time. After the team is done, the bathroom is sanitised and only then can the other team use it. We also have separate timings for eating at the cookhouse for the teams,” the official said.A major concern for the army stations and cantonments, which are isolated areas in a city, is the civilian manpower that is coming from outside. For example, washing points and blow drying of clothes have been setup outside the gates of one of the cantonments for this manpower.",the boy fell off his bike .,0.6335684

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

Straight-talking. Big-hearted. Decent. Those are some of the words used by others to describe Ken Little. He is best known for owning a long-standing fruit and vegetable store in Port Macquarie. But he is also widely respected for the huge amount of community work he does. Recently he was named our senior citizen of the year. But how much do you really know about him? What formed him and what makes him tick? Ken Little grew up on a farm at Ben Lomond near Glen Innes. He was the youngest child of 13. When he was born his father Benjamin was 67-years-old, his mother Ada only 38. His father had been left a widow with eight children with a farm to manage when his first wife died of cancer in the early 1940s. Ken's mother (who had two children of her own) was hired to work on the farm, manage the house and look after the younger children. Before long the two had fallen in love and had three more children, Jan, Benjamin and little Kenny. It was a simple childhood. On the farm he learnt the value of hard work. ""From an early age before I went to school I would milk the cows, ride or walk 5km to school,"" he recalls. ""Then after school I would round the cows up and separate the calves from their mothers so there would be milk for the next day. I also herded sheep."" The family moved to Port Macquarie when Mr Little was 10. He attended Port Primary School and Port Macquarie High School. By his own admission he was an ""average student"". But what he lacked academically he made up with other skills. ""I was always really active and independent, I played a lot of sport, fished a lot, played football,"" he said. The family didn't have a lot of money. His parents were on the old age pension. ""All the money I got I had earned from the time I was eight or nine,"" Mr Little said. ""My parents never gave me anything because they couldn't afford to."" When he was not playing sport or surfing he spent his weekends picking fruit to earn money. Towards the end of school he also began to notice girls. Mr Little met his wife Judy at the Kempsey showground when he was only 17. ""I liked her straight away, she smiled a lot, we got on,"" he said. He acknowledges it was easier to meet a partner back then but they were fortunate to find each other. When he left school he headed for Sydney like most young people. He had hoped to be a property evaluator but it didn't work out. He didn't like the city and missed the beach too much. Before long he was back in Port Macquarie, working in the fruit and veg department at Woolworths. Ironically, it was with one of his main competitors that his passion for the trade started. He set up Ken Little's Fruit and Veg in 1983. The small business originally run out of the Colonial Arcade. Disaster struck when Port Central was built. The road closures in Hay Street, loss of parking and heavy vehicle use in the area proved disastrous. ""We lost 85 per cent of our trade in a year,"" he said. ""I was stunned and devastated. I wondered if I could keep the business going and rebuild."" The business almost went bust and Judy went back to nursing to keep the family afloat. Difficult decisions were made but eventually they moved the business to Munster Street in 1996. The business started thriving but then in 2007 disaster hit again when a deliberately lit fire ripped through the store. ""Again I was thinking can I rebuild?"" he said. ""After lots of soul searching we decided to keep the business going for ourselves as we had put so much into it over the years, our staff and loyal customers,"" he said. ""We were able to gradually build the business up again and pay our bills."" The business now employs 45 staff and focuses on ""giving customers what they want"". His marriage to Judy has sustained him during difficult times. ""Like any marriage we have our ups and downs,"" he said. ""But we enjoy each other's company and we end up working things out. ""Sometimes you just need time and patience. We are different in a lot of ways, she is very artistic, and I love to watch and play sport. We don't try and change each other and the differences work."" He is proud but humble about his children's achievements. All have followed their passions. Eldest son Nigel holds a PhD in history and works for the Office of National Intelligence in Canberra. His second son Daniel is a talented former photographer. He is Ken's right hand man in the store. Daughter Naomi has travelled the world and currently lives in Denmark with her daughter working in marketing and design for an IT company. ""Do you know what the cloud is?"" he asks The Port News quizzically. Life can be difficult so how has Ken Little survived with such a sunny attitude? ""I've had a good life,"" he said. ""I try to enjoy all the simple things in life, I feel as though I live in paradise, I don't take anything or anyone for granted."" He holds fast to some principles his father taught him: ""Do unto others as you do unto yourself and if you have nothing nice to say about someone say nothing."" He is involved in a range of sporting and community groups, he has been a mentor, coach, fundraiser. What advice does he give the many young people he encounters? ""Try and stay positive,"" he said. ""When you fall down pick yourself up, remember every problem has a solution no matter how bad it is. ""Be a doer not a gonna, there are a lot of people in this world who make a loud noise that they are going to do this and going to do that but do nothing."" The Port News series is called In My Life.

"Crosses last fiscal’s figure with 67 days to spare this year

Crosses last fiscal’s figure with 67 days to spare this year

Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has increased its share of the first-year premium income in the first nine months of this fiscal. LIC’s share rose to 70.52% from 66.24% recorded in 2018-19.

“During the current fiscal, our market share improved in terms of first-year premium income. We have crossed last year’s collection of ₹1,42,000 crore in total first-year premium, 67 days ahead of the schedule,” Mukesh Kumar Gupta, managing director, LIC, said.

LIC also crossed ₹1 lakh crore in first year premium in the Pension and Group Insurance vertical for the first time. Mr. Gupta added that the insurance major had ₹32 lakh crore in assets and ₹29 lakh crore in investment. Recently, it had paid dividend of ₹2,611 crore to the Centre.

As of December, LIC had posted a growth of 17.81% in number of policies sold and 45.56% in first year premium income.

According to Mr. Gupta, LIC had set itself a target of ₹56,000 crore in individual business premium and ₹1.25 lakh crore for the pension and group insurance scheme for FY20. Together with renewal income of about ₹2 lakh crore, LIC would be gunning for the ₹4 lakh crore-mark this fiscal, he said. For FY21, LIC plans to increase the number of insurance agents from 12 lakh to 15 lakh. In this regard, it had already recruited officers and development officers. About 8,000 assistant officers would be placed soon.

On NPAs, he added that LIC’s net non-performing asset (NPA) ratio stood at 1% for the current fiscal, despite major defaults by some corporate borrowers. “We are doing well on all counts. Most loans are given through consortium and the consortium partners are working on it,” he said. Asked about the recovery mechanism, he said: “Provisions have been fully made and efforts are on to recover bad debts. ”

"Much more must be done to make radiotherapy treatment available worldwide, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a video message to mark World Cancer Day.

“We need to do much more than we ever thought it was possible,” Mr Grossi said in the message recorded as part of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 20 Leaders Campaign to mark the day. “With radiotherapy we kill tumors, with radiotherapy we ease pain, but in one-third of low- and middle-income countries there is a lack of radiotherapy treatment. Twenty-eight countries in Africa lack a single radiotherapy unit. In these countries a cancer diagnosis is often almost as a death sentence. This must change.”

Radiotherapy is one of the most widely used therapies for cancer treatment, but access to this cost-effective treatment option is limited, or non-existent, in many parts of the world. With a growing cancer incidence worldwide, the need to make radiation medicine more widely available is pressing, particularly in the developing world.

“Take breast or cervical cancer, these are easily treatable and curable in rich, industrialized nations,” Mr Grossi said in his message, highlighting that this not the case in poor countries, where 300,000 women die of cervical cancer every year. “This is a scandal. This must stop. The IAEA is ready to make radiotherapy treatment available in more countries,” he said.

The IAEA helps countries establish nuclear and radiation medicine services, from resource mobilization to the procurement of equipment and training of medical professionals.

The Agency will mark World Cancer Day at its headquarters with an event on Friday, 7 February, focusing on the role of nuclear and radiation medicine in the fight against cervical cancer.
