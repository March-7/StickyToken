"Thirteen of the 22 rebel Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh don't want to quit the party and were led away only to create pressure on the leadership to nominate Jyotiraditya Scindia to the Rajya Sabha, senior party leader Digvijaya Singh claimed on Wednesday.

He also asserted that the Kamal Nath-led government in the state, pushed to the brink of collapse with the resignation of 22 MLAs, will win a floor test.

On a day that Scindia joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, Singh said the former Union minister and four-time Lok Sabha MP from the Congress was offered the post of Madhya Pradesh deputy chief minister in 2018 when the party won the state elections but wanted his nominee appointed.

However, this was rejected by Kamal Nath as he didn't want a ""chela"" in that position, Singh said in an interview, a day after Scindia quit the Congress and 22 MLAs submitted their resignations from the assembly.

""The CM said he does not have any issue with Scindia becoming the deputy CM but told him, 'if you want your 'chela' to become deputy CM, then that will not happen'. Kamal Nath then took six of his (Scindia's) supporters in the cabinet,"" Singh revealed.

Two-three ministers close to Scindia as well as 10 of the rebel MLAs have given an assurance they are not leaving the Congress, he said.

""They were taken to Bengaluru to put pressure on the Congress to give Scindia a Rajya Sabha berth,"" Singh said.

""All the 22 MLAs, but for five or six, are Congress members who have been in Mr Scindia's group since Mr Madhavrao Scindia's time. So, all those people were there with him because they were with the Congress party,"" he added.

Singh said the party is in touch with the families of the MLAs.

""We are not keeping quiet. We are not sleeping,"" he declared.

Alleging the BJP's hand behind the crisis, he said the party's leaders carried the resignations of the Congress MLAs. Also, the BJP chartered flights to ferry Congress MLAs in two batches to Bengaluru, he claimed.

""It is all engineered, sponsored and paid for by the BJP... all part of the BJP's Operation Moneybag,"" he said and added that the phones of the rebel MLAs have been taken away and their conversations with family members are being recorded.

Singh admitted that the party did not anticipate that Scindia would leave the Congress to join the BJP and described the move as his ""ati-mahatvakansha"", or his over-ambition.

""We did not anticipate that Scindia will quit the Congress... that was a mistake. Someone who has got so much from the party- four-time MP, twice minister in Union Cabinet, Congress Working Committee member and party general secretary,"" he said.

""The Congress could have easily sent him to the Rajya Sabha with 122 MLAs on its side. But we could not have made him a cabinet minister. Only Modi-Shah can make (him) a cabinet minister not us,"" he added.

The remark was an oblique reference to reports that Scindia will be made a cabinet minister in the Modi government in return for his MLAs supporting BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan to form government in Madhya Pradesh.

""We will prove our majority. We will save the government,"" Singh said.

He also rejected theories of Scindia being unhappy with the party and the state government.

""In the entire Gwalior-Chambal region, the Congress is being run by Scindia. And even Kamal Nath ji ran the administrative machinery in coordination with him. Guna is my home district but even the SP and collector are appointed as per his (Scindia's) wishes. It's the same in Shivpuri, Gwalior, Ashok Nagar, Bhind and Morena.""

The two-time Madhya Pradesh chief minister said the assembly speaker, as per law, wants to verify the authenticity of the resignations tendered by the rebel MLAs by seeking their personal presence.

Detailing the sequence of events relating to the crisis in the state, he claimed Scindia was ""upset and frustrated"" when he lost the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and made overtures to Modi-Shah stating he could topple the Kamal Nath government.

""During the time, through a friend, he met Modi ji and Amit Shah,"" Singh said.

State BJP leaders were, however, opposed to the idea and were confident they could do the job themselves, he claimed, adding that Scindia was roped in when the local BJP leadership failed.

""Senior BJP leaders said if the government has to be brought down, we can do it, why do you have to take him (in the party). So they were asked to make an attempt. They tried...but we thwarted it.

""Then Amit Shah took them to task and said 'you are all useless ('nikamme nikle'), I am giving the task to (bring down the government) to Scindia ji',"" Singh claimed.

On his personal equation with Scindia, he said he had always remained in touch with Scindia and his father, the late Madhavrao Scindia.

Singh also recalled that he was instrumental in bringing Madhavrao Scindia to the Congress in 1979. Madhavrao Scindia's mother Vijaya Raje Scindia was one of the founding members of the BJP.

The Congress has a wafer thin majority in the 228-member assembly. Before the rebellion, its tally was 114. It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP MLAs and one from the SP, but some may now switch sides to the BJP.

If the resignations of the 22 MLAs are accepted, the strength of the assembly will fall to 206. The Congress, on its own, will then be left with 92 seats while the BJP has 107 seats with the magic number for a majority being 104.",world cup live : germany 0-0 ghana,0.4856038

In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing.

""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA.

""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.

SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic.

Singapore on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, after several cases of coronavirus without travel history to mainland China or links to previous cases.

The virus has infected 43 people in Singapore as of Sunday, six of whom have been discharged.

sheep are grazing in a grassy field near a stand of trees .,"MUMBAI: The much-awaited redevelopment of the Bombay Development Directorate (BDD) chawls at NM Joshi Marg will begin only after the draw of lots for rehab buildings, said an official with the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), on condition of anonymity. The state housing authority plans to conduct the draw of lots in a month’s time. However, the authority will finalise the date only once the ministry portfolios are distributed.

The official asserted that as cabinet expansion has taken place on December 30, the portfolios accumulated with the six cabinet ministers, who took oath along with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the first round, will now be distributed. Currently, NCP’s Jayant Patil is in charge of the housing ministry. Though a meeting was conducted with Minister Patil, only after portfolios are confirmed a detailed presentation about the BDD chawls’ redevelopment project will be made and the date for the draw of lots decided, explained the official.

Interestingly, the NM Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Phase-1 project construction work was expected to begin last year after Diwali. However, unable to vacate the first 10 chawls the project missed the deadline, and the plan failed to take off.

This paper had reported that in a bid to expedite the shifting of tenants, the MHADA has come up with an offer asking tenants to shift to transit houses wherein on first come first basis they will get an opportunity to participate in the lottery draw. By conducting this lottery draw, the participant tenants will know which floors of the new buildings their houses will be located. The lottery for rehab houses will be held from the top floors of the 22-storeyed building.

Besides, MHADA will also sign an agreement with the lottery winners, giving a surety that they will get their houses back, unlike the city’s other stuck redevelopment projects undertaken mostly by the private developers.

MHADA is drawing the lottery of top floor houses after tenants even after repeated appeals were not willing to leave their houses and shift to the provided alternative places. Following which, this offer was made in a bid to lure residents of getting houses on the top floors of the buildings once ready. So far, 252 families have shifted to the transit houses, informed the official.

At NM Joshi, the authority as per the approved plans will construct seven towers comprising 22 floors each in phase-1, which will house 1,200 tenements. To construct the seven new towers, 10 existing chawls are required to be demolished first.

The tenants of NM Joshi Marg, including Dadar-Naigaon BDD Chawl tenants, are provided alternative accommodation in mill buildings. Ruby Mill, Jubilee Mill, Prakash Cotton Mill, Western India Mill, Century Mill, and Bharat Mill are the six mills that have been identified and have a total of 1,127 transit houses, according to the MHADA.

The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had performed the ground-breaking ceremony in April 2017. However, till date, not a single brick has been laid. MHADA, on the other end, is still convincing residents to support the redevelopment of century-old BDD chawls, which have been planned costing of Rs 17,000 crore approximately. If successfully completed, about 16,000 families living in BDD chawls at NM Joshi, Naigaon and Worli will get new 500 square feet of flats free of cost.",0.5544189

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

The move comes after demand for air travel between Singapore and China declined significantly as a result of the outbreak, said SIA on its website.

As a result, services to some Chinese destinations will be ""temporarily suspended until the situation improves"", it added.

Several SIA flights between Singapore and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be suspended between Feb 4 and Mar 29.

Some SilkAir flights between Singapore and Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing will be halted during that period.

SIA said that the group will maintain some connectivity to key cities.

In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing.

""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA.

""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.

SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic.

SIA's low-cost carrier Scoot also suspended flights to 11 Chinese cities from early February until the end of March and reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.

Singapore on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, after several cases of coronavirus without travel history to mainland China or links to previous cases.

The virus has infected 43 people in Singapore as of Sunday, six of whom have been discharged.

The state housing authority plans to conduct the draw of lots in a month’s time. However, the authority will finalise the date only once the ministry portfolios are distributed.

The official asserted that as cabinet expansion has taken place on December 30, the portfolios accumulated with the six cabinet ministers, who took oath along with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the first round, will now be distributed. Currently, NCP’s Jayant Patil is in charge of the housing ministry. Though a meeting was conducted with Minister Patil, only after portfolios are confirmed a detailed presentation about the BDD chawls’ redevelopment project will be made and the date for the draw of lots decided, explained the official.

Interestingly, the NM Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Phase-1 project construction work was expected to begin last year after Diwali. However, unable to vacate the first 10 chawls the project missed the deadline, and the plan failed to take off.

This paper had reported that in a bid to expedite the shifting of tenants, the MHADA has come up with an offer asking tenants to shift to transit houses wherein on first come first basis they will get an opportunity to participate in the lottery draw. By conducting this lottery draw, the participant tenants will know which floors of the new buildings their houses will be located. The lottery for rehab houses will be held from the top floors of the 22-storeyed building.

Besides, MHADA will also sign an agreement with the lottery winners, giving a surety that they will get their houses back, unlike the city’s other stuck redevelopment projects undertaken mostly by the private developers.

MHADA is drawing the lottery of top floor houses after tenants even after repeated appeals were not willing to leave their houses and shift to the provided alternative places. Following which, this offer was made in a bid to lure residents of getting houses on the top floors of the buildings once ready. So far, 252 families have shifted to the transit houses, informed the official.

At NM Joshi, the authority as per the approved plans will construct seven towers comprising 22 floors each in phase-1, which will house 1,200 tenements. To construct the seven new towers, 10 existing chawls are required to be demolished first.

The tenants of NM Joshi Marg, including Dadar-Naigaon BDD Chawl tenants, are provided alternative accommodation in mill buildings. Ruby Mill, Jubilee Mill, Prakash Cotton Mill, Western India Mill, Century Mill, and Bharat Mill are the six mills that have been identified and have a total of 1,127 transit houses, according to the MHADA.

The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had performed the ground-breaking ceremony in April 2017. However, till date, not a single brick has been laid. MHADA, on the other end, is still convincing residents to support the redevelopment of century-old BDD chawls, which have been planned costing of Rs 17,000 crore approximately. If successfully completed, about 16,000 families living in BDD chawls at NM Joshi, Naigaon and Worli will get new 500 square feet of flats free of cost.",0.61259913

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

Google plans to implement new limitations in its Chrome web browser after discovering certain ads overuse CPU and data resources, costing users device battery life and money.

Announced in a post to the Chromium blog on Thursday, Google's restrictions target ads that ""consume a disproportionate share of device resources"" without user knowledge.

Chrome Product Manager Marshall Vale says a future update to Chrome will limit the resources poorly coded ads like cryptocurrency miners have access to before user interaction. Initially, Chrome is setting restriction thresholds to 4MB of network data or 14 seconds of CPU usage in a 30-second period. Alternatively, ads will be limited after 60 seconds of total CPU usage.

An ad frame will be redirected to an error page if it reaches one of the above thresholds, with the page informing users that said ad used too many resources and was therefore removed from active display.

According to in-house measurements, only 0.3% of current ads exceed the stipulated thresholds. Still, those ads account for 27% of network data used and 28% of all ad CPU usage on Chrome. The figures underscore the need for intervention.

Ad creators can view Chrome's access reports to see which ads were unloaded due to the new restrictions and make necessary adjustments.",0.62636226

In a statement on Wednesday, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the Dutch top diplomat will meet with President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

The talks will be focused on bilateral, regional and international issues, according to the statement.

The move comes after demand for air travel between Singapore and China declined significantly as a result of the outbreak, said SIA on its website.

As a result, services to some Chinese destinations will be ""temporarily suspended until the situation improves"", it added.

Several SIA flights between Singapore and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be suspended between Feb 4 and Mar 29.

Some SilkAir flights between Singapore and Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing will be halted during that period.

SIA said that the group will maintain some connectivity to key cities.

In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing.

""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA.

""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.

SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic.

SIA's low-cost carrier Scoot also suspended flights to 11 Chinese cities from early February until the end of March and reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.

"At least eight people in Germany who died of encephalitis likely contracted a rare virus from shrews, a small mole-like animal, that led to the fatal brain-swelling condition often caused by a viral infection.

Researchers looked at brain tissue from 56 people who developed encephalitis between 1999 and 2019. Samples revealed that at least eight people who died of encephalitis were infected with Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), Scientific American reported, citing a study recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

MYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA LIKELY CAUSED BY NEW VIRUS, SCIENTISTS SAY

Borna disease (BD), spread by the bicolored white-toothed shrew, is a fatal neurological disease that typically affects horses and sheep and is named after the city in eastern Germany where it first killed hundreds of horses in the 19th century. The findings published in the medical journal “confirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encephalitis,” Scientific American reported.

All eight of those who were infected with BD lived in rural areas and spent a lot of time outdoors. Many of the affected people had been around cats, which are known shrew catchers, as well. Researchers suspect the patients were exposed to the pathogen when the cats presented the dead shrews to their owners. They may have also inhaled dust that contained dried shrew urine (horses and sheep typically are infected after the small mammal urinates in hay.) However, exactly how the virus was transmitted to the patients is not yet known.

As of now, there is no known treatment for the rare virus, which “triggers the host’s immune system to attack brain tissue,” as per Scientific American, and typically causes headache, fever and confusion, which is later followed by “deep coma"" and death. That said, certain antiviral treatments are being considered.

The findings “provide additional material for a better understanding of the disease,” Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany and co-senior author of the study, told the publication. He noted that the risk of infection in humans is “pretty low.”

Moving forward, the researchers urged medical professionals to test for BD in patients with an “unclear cause” of encephalitis.

“BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions,” they wrote.","since being drafted into service in 1971 , it has racked up a record 45 accidents , with 393 deaths .",0.66702616

The group said that its member-schools will cease to exist if September opening shall be mandated, noting that if that happens, the problem of private schools may not be the lack of students but lack of teachers.

“It has to be understood that our teachers are hardly included in any amelioration projects of the government,” said FAPSA president Eleazardo Kasilag.

This comes after The IATF-MEID on Friday said that the opening of classes for the next school year should be scheduled in September, except for online learning.

Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, however, said that higher education institutions in areas under general community quarantine may continue classes to finish the academic year.

The group has asked the Department of Education to help private schools to coordinate with IATF-EID to include teachers from private schools in small business wage subsidy.

“We were left out in COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program, the DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) Emergency Subsidy Program and Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. This is indeed an oasis in the barren desert,” Kasilag said. “The teachers of our small and medium size member schools are crying for their survival right now.”

Kasilag stressed that private schools are not business entities as they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-stock, non-profit and they survive on tuition fees.

“We have big collectibles that we missed to get because classes are stopped in March,” Kasilag said. “FAPSA schools did not hold final exams and we did not hold graduation exercises. These two major events in schools are the culmination of school year 2019-2020 but they did not take place and they are also incentives for the indebted parents to pay arrearages.”

He stressed that from March to September are just seven long months when private school teachers will not receive anything.

“How will they survive? These are professional teachers wallowing in poverty. Their counterparts in public schools have no problem. I understand, public school teachers enjoy lavish food on table as seen on Facebooks showing off at the envy of their starving friends from the private schools,” said Kasilag.",0.6989263

The move comes after demand for air travel between Singapore and China declined significantly as a result of the outbreak, said SIA on its website.

As a result, services to some Chinese destinations will be ""temporarily suspended until the situation improves"", it added.

Several SIA flights between Singapore and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be suspended between Feb 4 and Mar 29.

Some SilkAir flights between Singapore and Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing will be halted during that period.

SIA said that the group will maintain some connectivity to key cities.

In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing.

""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA.

""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.

SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic.

SIA's low-cost carrier Scoot also suspended flights to 11 Chinese cities from early February until the end of March and reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.

Singapore on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, after several cases of coronavirus without travel history to mainland China or links to previous cases.

The virus has infected 43 people in Singapore as of Sunday, six of whom have been discharged.

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

“The economic hit will likely be more serious than the global financial crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic,” Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post. He said the pandemic will likely last at least this year, and possibly longer.

With 200 infections, the Asian travel hub has signaled that there is a chance of a recession this year and has cut its growth forecasts.

Lee’s comments came a day after Singapore revised its electoral boundaries, in a move usually seen as a precursor to calling a vote. Singapore must hold elections by early 2021. Before the virus hit the Asian city-state late in January, the government had been expected to call a vote within a few months.",0.70644444

- Politics news -

In a statement on Wednesday, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the Dutch top diplomat will meet with President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

The talks will be focused on bilateral, regional and international issues, according to the statement.

The visit would come as relations between Tehran and Amsterdam have soured in the past few years following the expulsion of two Iranian diplomats from the Netherlands in June 2018 and Tehran's reciprocal measure in February 2019.

After Iran's expulsion of two Dutch diplomats, the Netherlands summoned its ambassador to Tehran to hold consultations, and summoned the Iranian ambassador, describing the act as ""unacceptable"" and ""having negative consequences"" for bilateral relations.

The group said that its member-schools will cease to exist if September opening shall be mandated, noting that if that happens, the problem of private schools may not be the lack of students but lack of teachers.

“It has to be understood that our teachers are hardly included in any amelioration projects of the government,” said FAPSA president Eleazardo Kasilag.

This comes after The IATF-MEID on Friday said that the opening of classes for the next school year should be scheduled in September, except for online learning.

Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, however, said that higher education institutions in areas under general community quarantine may continue classes to finish the academic year.

The group has asked the Department of Education to help private schools to coordinate with IATF-EID to include teachers from private schools in small business wage subsidy.

“We were left out in COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program, the DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) Emergency Subsidy Program and Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. This is indeed an oasis in the barren desert,” Kasilag said. “The teachers of our small and medium size member schools are crying for their survival right now.”

Kasilag stressed that private schools are not business entities as they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-stock, non-profit and they survive on tuition fees.

“We have big collectibles that we missed to get because classes are stopped in March,” Kasilag said. “FAPSA schools did not hold final exams and we did not hold graduation exercises. These two major events in schools are the culmination of school year 2019-2020 but they did not take place and they are also incentives for the indebted parents to pay arrearages.”

He stressed that from March to September are just seven long months when private school teachers will not receive anything.

“How will they survive? These are professional teachers wallowing in poverty. Their counterparts in public schools have no problem. I understand, public school teachers enjoy lavish food on table as seen on Facebooks showing off at the envy of their starving friends from the private schools,” said Kasilag.",0.71079147

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.","Gains made in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission could be reversed due to interruptions caused by Covid-19.

"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s prime minister warned on Saturday that the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will likely be deeper and more prolonged than the 2008 financial crisis, Reuters reported.

“The economic hit will likely be more serious than the global financial crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic,” Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post. He said the pandemic will likely last at least this year, and possibly longer.

With 200 infections, the Asian travel hub has signaled that there is a chance of a recession this year and has cut its growth forecasts.

Lee’s comments came a day after Singapore revised its electoral boundaries, in a move usually seen as a precursor to calling a vote. Singapore must hold elections by early 2021. Before the virus hit the Asian city-state late in January, the government had been expected to call a vote within a few months.","Sign up to FREE daily email alerts from walesonline - daily Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

More foldable smartphones and a new generation of games consoles are likely to be among the biggest new gadgets of 2020.

Here is a look at what to expect over the coming 12 months in the world of technology.

A 5G iPhone

While some manufacturers have been quick to introduce 5G smartphones even as the network coverage only begins to appear, Apple is yet to bring the connectivity to the iPhone.

Many believe this will change in 2020, with a 5G iPhone introduced alongside a number of other iPhone handsets.

It would be seen as a watershed moment for the technology by some - Apple's status as a brand means that innovation is not always considered mainstream until the Cupertino firm is involved.

By the time a 5G iPhone arrives - likely to be in September - 5G coverage should be far wider than it is currently - wide enough that Apple feels it is time to add the connectivity to its smartphone.

The new console wars

2020 looks likely to be one of the biggest and most important years in the video games industry for some time.

Not only is cloud streaming taking off, allowing console-standard gaming on mobile devices, but both Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation will launch their next-generation consoles in time for next Christmas.

The Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 have both been confirmed, complete with high-end specs which both say will make them the most powerful consoles either firm has ever made.

It will be a redrawing of the battle lines for the two biggest names in gaming, as they compete to set the standard for the next generation of video games.

More foldable phones

As 2019 draws to a close, only Samsung of the major smartphone makers has a foldable device on sale in the UK - expect that to drastically change in 2020.

Samsung itself has already hinted at new types of foldable phones which could be on the way, while Motorola's revamped, foldable Razr will also become available.

Huawei's Mate X has gone on sale in China, but could 2020 see it or another Huawei foldable make it to Europe?

A number of smaller firms are also likely to try and break the status quo too - some of which could choose to reveal themselves during the CES trade show in Las Vegas, early in the new year.

Microsoft's Surface Duo and Neo

Not quite fully-fledged foldables, but Microsoft's Surface Duo and Surface Neo will make their debut in 2020, attempting to be a new type of mobile device.

Both gadgets have two screens bound together by a hinge and can fold into a number of positions. Both are due to go on sale at the end of 2020.

The Duo is smartphone-sized, while the Neo is closer to that of a laptop or tablet - however, Microsoft is adamant neither should be considered as part of those categories.

In much the same way the tech giant's Surface helped create the ""two-in-one"" category of tablet combined with laptop, Microsoft hopes the Duo and Neo can change how people use their devices every day.",0.74397874

"Brunette bombshell Ana Cheri knows how to get the attention of her 12.4 million followers. Most of the time that involves baring lots of skin. In her latest Instagram update, the beauty teased fans by giving them a flash of cleavage when she unzipped her workout bra in a flirty video.

Ana's clip showed her modeling several workout bras and a pair of yoga pants from her clothing line, Cheri Fit. The video captured her body from her hips up as she stood near a wall covered with floral wallpaper.

The first portion of the video proved to be the most sexy as she lowered the zipper on her black bra while flashing a smile at the camera. Before the zipper came undone, she quickly closed it up. She then lifted her hair, spun around, and gave followers a look at the back of the bra. Ana swayed her hips back and forth before the clip jumped to her wearing a different bra. It showed her backside for a few seconds before she turned around and faced the front.

The video continued in the same fashion, showing the beauty in a variety of bras in colors that included red and pink. All of them showed off her cleavage and hourglass shape as she struck several coy poses. At one point in the clip, she playfully held a rose and waved it at the camera. The clip ended showing Ana wearing a pink, long-sleeved crop top.

As for makeup, Ana's eyes were framed with dark brows, smoky eye shadow and thick lashes. She also wore a rose gloss on her lips.

In the caption, she announced that Cheri Fit was having a sale on tops for Valentine's Day.

Many of her fans wished her a happy holiday, while others showered her with compliments.

""Wow your [sic] just so beautiful,"" one admirer told her.

""Absolutely gorgeous in every way,"" said a second follower.

""Omg love this and you girl,"" a third Instagram user wrote.

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

###","The Federation of Associations of Private School Administrators (FAPSA) on Friday expressed dismay on the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID) that classes should resume in September.

The group said that its member-schools will cease to exist if September opening shall be mandated, noting that if that happens, the problem of private schools may not be the lack of students but lack of teachers.

“It has to be understood that our teachers are hardly included in any amelioration projects of the government,” said FAPSA president Eleazardo Kasilag.

This comes after The IATF-MEID on Friday said that the opening of classes for the next school year should be scheduled in September, except for online learning.

Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, however, said that higher education institutions in areas under general community quarantine may continue classes to finish the academic year.

The group has asked the Department of Education to help private schools to coordinate with IATF-EID to include teachers from private schools in small business wage subsidy.

“We were left out in COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program, the DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) Emergency Subsidy Program and Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. This is indeed an oasis in the barren desert,” Kasilag said. “The teachers of our small and medium size member schools are crying for their survival right now.”

Kasilag stressed that private schools are not business entities as they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-stock, non-profit and they survive on tuition fees.

“We have big collectibles that we missed to get because classes are stopped in March,” Kasilag said. “FAPSA schools did not hold final exams and we did not hold graduation exercises. These two major events in schools are the culmination of school year 2019-2020 but they did not take place and they are also incentives for the indebted parents to pay arrearages.”

He stressed that from March to September are just seven long months when private school teachers will not receive anything.

“How will they survive? These are professional teachers wallowing in poverty. Their counterparts in public schools have no problem. I understand, public school teachers enjoy lavish food on table as seen on Facebooks showing off at the envy of their starving friends from the private schools,” said Kasilag.",0.77080476

"At least eight people in Germany who died of encephalitis likely contracted a rare virus from shrews, a small mole-like animal, that led to the fatal brain-swelling condition often caused by a viral infection.

Researchers looked at brain tissue from 56 people who developed encephalitis between 1999 and 2019. Samples revealed that at least eight people who died of encephalitis were infected with Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), Scientific American reported, citing a study recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

MYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA LIKELY CAUSED BY NEW VIRUS, SCIENTISTS SAY

Borna disease (BD), spread by the bicolored white-toothed shrew, is a fatal neurological disease that typically affects horses and sheep and is named after the city in eastern Germany where it first killed hundreds of horses in the 19th century. The findings published in the medical journal “confirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encephalitis,” Scientific American reported.

All eight of those who were infected with BD lived in rural areas and spent a lot of time outdoors. Many of the affected people had been around cats, which are known shrew catchers, as well. Researchers suspect the patients were exposed to the pathogen when the cats presented the dead shrews to their owners. They may have also inhaled dust that contained dried shrew urine (horses and sheep typically are infected after the small mammal urinates in hay.) However, exactly how the virus was transmitted to the patients is not yet known.

As of now, there is no known treatment for the rare virus, which “triggers the host’s immune system to attack brain tissue,” as per Scientific American, and typically causes headache, fever and confusion, which is later followed by “deep coma"" and death. That said, certain antiviral treatments are being considered.

The findings “provide additional material for a better understanding of the disease,” Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany and co-senior author of the study, told the publication. He noted that the risk of infection in humans is “pretty low.”

Moving forward, the researchers urged medical professionals to test for BD in patients with an “unclear cause” of encephalitis.

“BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions,” they wrote.","Gains made in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission could be reversed due to interruptions caused by Covid-19.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”",0.80560756

"Thirteen of the 22 rebel Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh don't want to quit the party and were led away only to create pressure on the leadership to nominate Jyotiraditya Scindia to the Rajya Sabha, senior party leader Digvijaya Singh claimed on Wednesday.

He also asserted that the Kamal Nath-led government in the state, pushed to the brink of collapse with the resignation of 22 MLAs, will win a floor test.

On a day that Scindia joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, Singh said the former Union minister and four-time Lok Sabha MP from the Congress was offered the post of Madhya Pradesh deputy chief minister in 2018 when the party won the state elections but wanted his nominee appointed.

However, this was rejected by Kamal Nath as he didn't want a ""chela"" in that position, Singh said in an interview, a day after Scindia quit the Congress and 22 MLAs submitted their resignations from the assembly.

""The CM said he does not have any issue with Scindia becoming the deputy CM but told him, 'if you want your 'chela' to become deputy CM, then that will not happen'. Kamal Nath then took six of his (Scindia's) supporters in the cabinet,"" Singh revealed.

Two-three ministers close to Scindia as well as 10 of the rebel MLAs have given an assurance they are not leaving the Congress, he said.

""They were taken to Bengaluru to put pressure on the Congress to give Scindia a Rajya Sabha berth,"" Singh said.

""All the 22 MLAs, but for five or six, are Congress members who have been in Mr Scindia's group since Mr Madhavrao Scindia's time. So, all those people were there with him because they were with the Congress party,"" he added.

Singh said the party is in touch with the families of the MLAs.

""We are not keeping quiet. We are not sleeping,"" he declared.

Alleging the BJP's hand behind the crisis, he said the party's leaders carried the resignations of the Congress MLAs. Also, the BJP chartered flights to ferry Congress MLAs in two batches to Bengaluru, he claimed.

""It is all engineered, sponsored and paid for by the BJP... all part of the BJP's Operation Moneybag,"" he said and added that the phones of the rebel MLAs have been taken away and their conversations with family members are being recorded.

Singh admitted that the party did not anticipate that Scindia would leave the Congress to join the BJP and described the move as his ""ati-mahatvakansha"", or his over-ambition.

""We did not anticipate that Scindia will quit the Congress... that was a mistake. Someone who has got so much from the party- four-time MP, twice minister in Union Cabinet, Congress Working Committee member and party general secretary,"" he said.

""The Congress could have easily sent him to the Rajya Sabha with 122 MLAs on its side. But we could not have made him a cabinet minister. Only Modi-Shah can make (him) a cabinet minister not us,"" he added.

The remark was an oblique reference to reports that Scindia will be made a cabinet minister in the Modi government in return for his MLAs supporting BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan to form government in Madhya Pradesh.

""We will prove our majority. We will save the government,"" Singh said.

He also rejected theories of Scindia being unhappy with the party and the state government.

""In the entire Gwalior-Chambal region, the Congress is being run by Scindia. And even Kamal Nath ji ran the administrative machinery in coordination with him. Guna is my home district but even the SP and collector are appointed as per his (Scindia's) wishes. It's the same in Shivpuri, Gwalior, Ashok Nagar, Bhind and Morena.""

The two-time Madhya Pradesh chief minister said the assembly speaker, as per law, wants to verify the authenticity of the resignations tendered by the rebel MLAs by seeking their personal presence.

Detailing the sequence of events relating to the crisis in the state, he claimed Scindia was ""upset and frustrated"" when he lost the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and made overtures to Modi-Shah stating he could topple the Kamal Nath government.

""During the time, through a friend, he met Modi ji and Amit Shah,"" Singh said.

State BJP leaders were, however, opposed to the idea and were confident they could do the job themselves, he claimed, adding that Scindia was roped in when the local BJP leadership failed.

""Senior BJP leaders said if the government has to be brought down, we can do it, why do you have to take him (in the party). So they were asked to make an attempt. They tried...but we thwarted it.

""Then Amit Shah took them to task and said 'you are all useless ('nikamme nikle'), I am giving the task to (bring down the government) to Scindia ji',"" Singh claimed.

On his personal equation with Scindia, he said he had always remained in touch with Scindia and his father, the late Madhavrao Scindia.

Singh also recalled that he was instrumental in bringing Madhavrao Scindia to the Congress in 1979. Madhavrao Scindia's mother Vijaya Raje Scindia was one of the founding members of the BJP.

The Congress has a wafer thin majority in the 228-member assembly. Before the rebellion, its tally was 114. It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP MLAs and one from the SP, but some may now switch sides to the BJP.

If the resignations of the 22 MLAs are accepted, the strength of the assembly will fall to 206. The Congress, on its own, will then be left with 92 seats while the BJP has 107 seats with the magic number for a majority being 104.","MUMBAI: The much-awaited redevelopment of the Bombay Development Directorate (BDD) chawls at NM Joshi Marg will begin only after the draw of lots for rehab buildings, said an official with the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), on condition of anonymity. The state housing authority plans to conduct the draw of lots in a month’s time. However, the authority will finalise the date only once the ministry portfolios are distributed.

The official asserted that as cabinet expansion has taken place on December 30, the portfolios accumulated with the six cabinet ministers, who took oath along with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the first round, will now be distributed. Currently, NCP’s Jayant Patil is in charge of the housing ministry. Though a meeting was conducted with Minister Patil, only after portfolios are confirmed a detailed presentation about the BDD chawls’ redevelopment project will be made and the date for the draw of lots decided, explained the official.

Interestingly, the NM Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Phase-1 project construction work was expected to begin last year after Diwali. However, unable to vacate the first 10 chawls the project missed the deadline, and the plan failed to take off.

This paper had reported that in a bid to expedite the shifting of tenants, the MHADA has come up with an offer asking tenants to shift to transit houses wherein on first come first basis they will get an opportunity to participate in the lottery draw. By conducting this lottery draw, the participant tenants will know which floors of the new buildings their houses will be located. The lottery for rehab houses will be held from the top floors of the 22-storeyed building.

Besides, MHADA will also sign an agreement with the lottery winners, giving a surety that they will get their houses back, unlike the city’s other stuck redevelopment projects undertaken mostly by the private developers.

MHADA is drawing the lottery of top floor houses after tenants even after repeated appeals were not willing to leave their houses and shift to the provided alternative places. Following which, this offer was made in a bid to lure residents of getting houses on the top floors of the buildings once ready. So far, 252 families have shifted to the transit houses, informed the official.

At NM Joshi, the authority as per the approved plans will construct seven towers comprising 22 floors each in phase-1, which will house 1,200 tenements. To construct the seven new towers, 10 existing chawls are required to be demolished first.

The tenants of NM Joshi Marg, including Dadar-Naigaon BDD Chawl tenants, are provided alternative accommodation in mill buildings. Ruby Mill, Jubilee Mill, Prakash Cotton Mill, Western India Mill, Century Mill, and Bharat Mill are the six mills that have been identified and have a total of 1,127 transit houses, according to the MHADA.

The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had performed the ground-breaking ceremony in April 2017. However, till date, not a single brick has been laid. MHADA, on the other end, is still convincing residents to support the redevelopment of century-old BDD chawls, which have been planned costing of Rs 17,000 crore approximately. If successfully completed, about 16,000 families living in BDD chawls at NM Joshi, Naigaon and Worli will get new 500 square feet of flats free of cost.",0.81549543

"At least eight people in Germany who died of encephalitis likely contracted a rare virus from shrews, a small mole-like animal, that led to the fatal brain-swelling condition often caused by a viral infection.

Researchers looked at brain tissue from 56 people who developed encephalitis between 1999 and 2019. Samples revealed that at least eight people who died of encephalitis were infected with Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), Scientific American reported, citing a study recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

MYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA LIKELY CAUSED BY NEW VIRUS, SCIENTISTS SAY

Borna disease (BD), spread by the bicolored white-toothed shrew, is a fatal neurological disease that typically affects horses and sheep and is named after the city in eastern Germany where it first killed hundreds of horses in the 19th century. The findings published in the medical journal “confirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encephalitis,” Scientific American reported.

All eight of those who were infected with BD lived in rural areas and spent a lot of time outdoors. Many of the affected people had been around cats, which are known shrew catchers, as well. Researchers suspect the patients were exposed to the pathogen when the cats presented the dead shrews to their owners. They may have also inhaled dust that contained dried shrew urine (horses and sheep typically are infected after the small mammal urinates in hay.) However, exactly how the virus was transmitted to the patients is not yet known.

As of now, there is no known treatment for the rare virus, which “triggers the host’s immune system to attack brain tissue,” as per Scientific American, and typically causes headache, fever and confusion, which is later followed by “deep coma"" and death. That said, certain antiviral treatments are being considered.

The findings “provide additional material for a better understanding of the disease,” Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany and co-senior author of the study, told the publication. He noted that the risk of infection in humans is “pretty low.”

Moving forward, the researchers urged medical professionals to test for BD in patients with an “unclear cause” of encephalitis.

“BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions,” they wrote.","SINGAPORE: Singapore’s prime minister warned on Saturday that the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will likely be deeper and more prolonged than the 2008 financial crisis, Reuters reported.

###","Gains made in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission could be reversed due to interruptions caused by Covid-19.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”",0.8256197

More foldable smartphones and a new generation of games consoles are likely to be among the biggest new gadgets of 2020.

Here is a look at what to expect over the coming 12 months in the world of technology.

A 5G iPhone

While some manufacturers have been quick to introduce 5G smartphones even as the network coverage only begins to appear, Apple is yet to bring the connectivity to the iPhone.

Many believe this will change in 2020, with a 5G iPhone introduced alongside a number of other iPhone handsets.

It would be seen as a watershed moment for the technology by some - Apple's status as a brand means that innovation is not always considered mainstream until the Cupertino firm is involved.

By the time a 5G iPhone arrives - likely to be in September - 5G coverage should be far wider than it is currently - wide enough that Apple feels it is time to add the connectivity to its smartphone.

The new console wars

2020 looks likely to be one of the biggest and most important years in the video games industry for some time.

Not only is cloud streaming taking off, allowing console-standard gaming on mobile devices, but both Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation will launch their next-generation consoles in time for next Christmas.

The Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 have both been confirmed, complete with high-end specs which both say will make them the most powerful consoles either firm has ever made.

It will be a redrawing of the battle lines for the two biggest names in gaming, as they compete to set the standard for the next generation of video games.

More foldable phones

As 2019 draws to a close, only Samsung of the major smartphone makers has a foldable device on sale in the UK - expect that to drastically change in 2020.

Samsung itself has already hinted at new types of foldable phones which could be on the way, while Motorola's revamped, foldable Razr will also become available.

Huawei's Mate X has gone on sale in China, but could 2020 see it or another Huawei foldable make it to Europe?

A number of smaller firms are also likely to try and break the status quo too - some of which could choose to reveal themselves during the CES trade show in Las Vegas, early in the new year.

Microsoft's Surface Duo and Neo

Not quite fully-fledged foldables, but Microsoft's Surface Duo and Surface Neo will make their debut in 2020, attempting to be a new type of mobile device.

Both gadgets have two screens bound together by a hinge and can fold into a number of positions. Both are due to go on sale at the end of 2020.

The Duo is smartphone-sized, while the Neo is closer to that of a laptop or tablet - however, Microsoft is adamant neither should be considered as part of those categories.

In much the same way the tech giant's Surface helped create the ""two-in-one"" category of tablet combined with laptop, Microsoft hopes the Duo and Neo can change how people use their devices every day.","Our team is dedicated to finding and telling you more about the products and deals we love.

As we head into a fresh decade, new life choices and resolutions abound. From getting into shape to getting more organized, there are no wrong resolutions here!

But after a decade of climate change conversations and a year that was defined by events like the Global Climate Strike, we have a feeling that many people will be going into 2020 looking to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable.

So if you are one of those people looking to make a few changes for the good of Mother Earth, don't get overwhelmed -- being more eco-friendly doesn't have to be intimidating or difficult. For starters, you can make a few quick swaps at home! Think: stop using single-use water bottles in favor of a reusable one, begin to use silicone food bags instead of plastic baggies for your snacks and add multi-use makeup remover pads to your beauty routine as opposed to disposable wipes. Now if you're thinking that these changes may seem small and inconsequential, a drop in the ocean creates a ripple, right?

"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s prime minister warned on Saturday that the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will likely be deeper and more prolonged than the 2008 financial crisis, Reuters reported.

“The economic hit will likely be more serious than the global financial crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic,” Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post. He said the pandemic will likely last at least this year, and possibly longer.

With 200 infections, the Asian travel hub has signaled that there is a chance of a recession this year and has cut its growth forecasts.

Lee’s comments came a day after Singapore revised its electoral boundaries, in a move usually seen as a precursor to calling a vote. Singapore must hold elections by early 2021. Before the virus hit the Asian city-state late in January, the government had been expected to call a vote within a few months.","Gains made in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission could be reversed due to interruptions caused by Covid-19.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”",0.8483712

The move comes after demand for air travel between Singapore and China declined significantly as a result of the outbreak, said SIA on its website.

As a result, services to some Chinese destinations will be ""temporarily suspended until the situation improves"", it added.

Several SIA flights between Singapore and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be suspended between Feb 4 and Mar 29.

Some SilkAir flights between Singapore and Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing will be halted during that period.

SIA said that the group will maintain some connectivity to key cities.

In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing.

""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA.

""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.

SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic.

SIA's low-cost carrier Scoot also suspended flights to 11 Chinese cities from early February until the end of March and reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.

Singapore on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, after several cases of coronavirus without travel history to mainland China or links to previous cases.

The virus has infected 43 people in Singapore as of Sunday, six of whom have been discharged.

"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.","AppleInsider is supported by its audience and may earn commission as an Amazon Associate and affiliate partner on qualifying purchases.

Google plans to implement new limitations in its Chrome web browser after discovering certain ads overuse CPU and data resources, costing users device battery life and money.

Announced in a post to the Chromium blog on Thursday, Google's restrictions target ads that ""consume a disproportionate share of device resources"" without user knowledge.

Chrome Product Manager Marshall Vale says a future update to Chrome will limit the resources poorly coded ads like cryptocurrency miners have access to before user interaction. Initially, Chrome is setting restriction thresholds to 4MB of network data or 14 seconds of CPU usage in a 30-second period. Alternatively, ads will be limited after 60 seconds of total CPU usage.

An ad frame will be redirected to an error page if it reaches one of the above thresholds, with the page informing users that said ad used too many resources and was therefore removed from active display.

According to in-house measurements, only 0.3% of current ads exceed the stipulated thresholds. Still, those ads account for 27% of network data used and 28% of all ad CPU usage on Chrome. The figures underscore the need for intervention.

Ad creators can view Chrome's access reports to see which ads were unloaded due to the new restrictions and make necessary adjustments.",0.9388741
