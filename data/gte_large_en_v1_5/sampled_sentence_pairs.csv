Gaming and the esports industry — characterized by massive video game tournaments — saw unprecedented growth in 2019 as investors recognized opportunity.

Now, heading into 2020, the gaming sector is poised to further shift into a lucrative market as increased interest supports the growth of players in the space.

Here the Investing News Network (INN) turns to experts in the market to get a sense of what’s in store for investors looking to plug into the esports industry in the new year.

Gaming outlook 2020: A closer look at the numbers

The esports industry is looking to capitalize on a successful 2019 moving into 2020 and beyond.

In its 2019 global games market report, gaming research firm Newzoo states that the international gaming market could be worth US$196 billion by 2022.

Mobile games in particular are projected to generate US$95.4 billion by 2022, driven primarily by smartphone activity. Cross-platform titles such as Mario Kart Tour on iOS and Android, a general increase in smartphone users and improvements to hardware and infrastructure are factors that will lead to the projected growth, according to the firm.

The console segment, on the other hand, is set to reach US$61.1 billion in 2022, Newzoo estimates, boosted by the upcoming generation of Xbox and PlayStation systems, created by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE,TSE:6758), respectively.

PC gaming will be a bit slower in the coming years, according to the researchers, though it is gaining traction and could be valued at US$39.5 billion over the next two year period.

In a previous interview with INN, Erik Dekker, senior vice president and portfolio manager with Dekker Hewett Group at Canaccord Genuity, said, “Gaming is bigger than film box offices, bigger than television, bigger than digital music. I think it’s about a US$116 billion market at this time.”

Gaming outlook 2020: The growth of team organizations

In esports, organizations like Team Liquid and OG are big generators of cash for the industry. Team Liquid, which has teams in many of the top esports leagues, currently has a merchandise collaboration with Marvel, and OG just announced a Counter Strike: Global Offensive team following its big Dota 2 win.

Team support and attachment have been reflected in the sheer amount of interest in gaming tournaments, another important revenue stream for esport companies.

In August, the Dota 2 The International 9 tournament had the world’s largest prize pool in history at a whopping US$34.3 million in winnings, and OG took home the top prize.

But organizations are evolving to rely on more than just their athletes and tournaments — instead, they’re taking a holistic approach to branding and maintaining a public image.

“It’s going to ultimately come down to teams that can create brand lifestyles, create great content programming and diversify the revenue streams to find more profitability,” Daniel Mitre, CEO of New Wave Esports (CSE:NWES), told INN via email.

Mitre said the impressive growth of the sector has already led heavy hitters in gaming to throw their hats into the ring. The executive explained that companies like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Riot Games, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Tencent (HKEX:0700), have carefully crafted plans attached to their esports franchises and leagues.

“None of this movement around big games, AAA publishers and developers is coming to a slow,” said Mitre. “In fact, it’s just going to start picking up further.”

This sentiment was shared by another expert in gaming who is optimistic about the market’s trajectory.

Haywood Securities investment banker Sean MacGillis said the skill of the gaming industry is in the flexibility of its revenue channels, which include everything from merchandise and ticket sales to advertising and sponsorship revenue.

“The ability to monetize games is an order of magnitude larger than the ability to monetize traditional forms of content,” MacGillis explained.

Gaming outlook 2020: Possible concerns in the new year

Some experts have noted possible pitfalls for the industry, despite its recent levels of success.

For Nick Mersch, associate portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, the biggest risks for the space could come with the hypothetical collapse of the Overwatch League, one of the biggest leagues in the sector. Mersch said a downturn for the league could turn off existing and prospective investors.

“A lot of traditional sports owners wrote huge checks into teams in this league, and if they get burned here it will be difficult to attract capital back to the space,” Mersch told INN.

According to a report from Variety, viewers for the Overwatch League Grand Finals grew by 16 percent in 2019, with the event reaching 1.12 million average viewers.

Mersch said he’s also keeping his eye on the overvaluation that has plagued esports, pointing to a recent Forbes list ranking “the most valuable companies in esports” that still seems to exaggerate the values of some organizations on it, according to the expert.

Other concerns have larger political implications. The ongoing US-China trade war dampened the growth of the sector, according to Trevor Doerksen, CEO of ePlay Digital (CSE:EPY), and could continue to do so into 2020, especially given China’s place as one of the world’s largest hubs for gaming.

In 2019, it was projected that US$36.5 billion was spent on gaming in China, according to Newzoo.

“Geopolitical forces and the US-China trade war muted global collaboration and access to markets, and important data that would help better understand and grow esports in 2019,” said Doerksen.

The executive said there could be better access to content, games and data across both markets if the relationship between the two countries improves in 2020.

Gaming outlook 2020: Investor takeaway

Mersch said moving forward, the most important factor for gaming will be the work done by data firm Nielsen, owned by The Nielsen Company (NYSE:NLSN), in its esports division, which works to get accurate information on engagement and viewership data.

In his view, Nielsen’s work could help close the existing gap between how the industry is growing and how it’s monetizing that growth, Mersch told INN.

“To close this gap, Fortune 500 companies need actionable return of investment metrics in order to justify more (spending) in the space. Nielsen and other data analytic companies can provide this.”

In terms of the overall health within the sector, Mitre told INN that the increasing popularity of gaming and its viewership will help in building a strong foundation for an interesting investment market.

“We’ve always had this propensity to watch people play better than us, whether it’s standing at the arcade and watching someone play Street Fighter, or the emergence of a Twitch and YouTube influencer space watching other people play video games,” said Mitre.

"New 2020 is almost upon us and it’s going to be a landmark year for gaming. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are coming, some long-awaited titles like The Last of Us Part II and Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally arrive, and cloud gaming and other new ways to play will continue to make inroads. 2020 is going to be a year of transition and upheaval for our hobby, which means it’s a great time for all good little gamers to turn over a new leaf. To make some New Year’s resolutions that will improve your own situation and the gaming scene as a whole.

Of course, sometimes it’s tough to come up with good resolutions, so I’m here to help! Here are a few 2020 gaming resolution suggestions to get your minds percolating…

The Financial Year in Tech 2019: Highs, Lows, and Future Trends

Slim Down Your Backlog in January and February

It’s time to put your pile of shame on a diet. 2020 will eventually see some big releases, with March and April being particularly crazy, but the first two months of the year? Those are unusually barren, so it’s time to finally finish up some of those games that have been lingering for weeks, months, or even years. Personally, I’m finally going to see the end of Red Dead Redemption 2. It, uh, all turns out great, right?

Truly Master at Least One Game

While that aforementioned March-April period will be out of control (get ready for Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 3, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more within the span of weeks) but, overall, 2020 is a transition year. Things will probably be a bit slower than usual, particularly if you don’t pick up a PS4 or Xbox Series X (we’ll talk about that later). That means, instead of increasing your pile of shame, 2020 is a great year to really drill down and master something. Really become good at a fighting or action game or 100 percent that new RPG. It’s more satisfying to master one game than half-finish a half dozen, and your bank account will thank you.

Stop Fighting Steam and Epic’s Battles for Them

Thankfully, it already seems to be dying down a bit, but the Steam vs. Epic Games Store Wars were the most pointless thing we devoted our time to in 2019. These massively-profitable companies don’t need you fighting their battles for them. Downloading an extra launcher is not a huge imposition, and we’re finally starting to see some real, consumer-benefitting competition, with both Steam and Epic offering some great promotions this holiday season.

Arise: A Simple Story Review – A Good Life, A So-So Video Game

I’d say you should all give up your console and NVIDIA vs. AMD wars as well, but I’m trying to keep these resolutions at least somewhat realistic.

Stay Vigilant About Monetization

2019 was the year the loot box died (or least started writing up its Last Will and Testament) and it was regular players speaking up that forced the change. The big publishers certainly wouldn’t have given them up on their own. That said, do keep an eye out for new monetization schemes, because you know certain publishers are diligently working on their next big money-grubbing innovation.

Don’t Buy a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X at Launch

I won’t be sticking to this resolution myself, but if you don’t strictly need a next-gen console for your job like I do, wait a while to buy PS5 or Xbox Series X. Consoles are overpriced at launch and it takes a while before you know if a machine is going to be successful. Also, in most cases, the first great, truly next-gen games don’t come out until about a year into a console’s lifespan. Both the PS5 and XSX are probably going to be around for a while, so sit back, consider your options, and make an informed decision.

Do Buy a Switch if You Haven’t Already

But maybe you have some cash earmarked for a new console just burning a hole in your pocket? Well, if you haven’t already, go ahead and grab yourself a Switch. Yes, it’s not the most powerful machine on the market, but 2019 was the year Nintendo’s little system definitively proved it was more than just a gimmick. The Switch boasts a fantastic library featuring top-notch Nintendo exclusives, the best indies of the past five years, and a handful of surprisingly-solid triple-A ports. I’m a pretty platform-agnostic kind of guy, but this past year most of my gaming free time was spent on the Switch. You might be surprised to find the same thing happening to you.

Don’t Be Jerks to People Who Make the Games You Love

We’re all passionate about his hobby, but that passion can turn into anger when a game or series does something you don’t like. I totally get that, but that said, do keep in mind that games are made by real people, most of whom are just trying their best to make something that will entertain players, so don’t lash out at them. Most of the decisions you’re upset about were probably made by committee in fancy boardrooms, so reserve your anger for publishers, not the rank and file. Also, do try to support devs when stories of crunch or workplace toxicity come out. Happy devs make better games, so better workplace conditions benefit everyone.

Play More Games With Friends

I’ve always believed gaming is at its best when you’re playing with someone close to you on the same couch, or, failing that, a real friend over the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall into the habit of just playing randoms online – to start thinking of the people you’re playing strictly as adversaries instead of friends. A lot of modern games, particularly battle royale stuff, really encourages that. I can guarantee you’ll feel a little better about the hobby, and have to absorb a lot less abuse from trolls, if you make the time to game with friends and family more often.

Try Something New…

As I’ve said, 2020 is a transition year, so why not branch out with something new? Give a genre you’ve never tried a spin, or give one you gave up on long ago another shot. Give that quirky indie a chance. A lot of 2019’s best games were off the regular beaten path, and the same will probably hold true for 2020.

…But Don’t Be Ashamed to Like What You Like

That said, while trying something new is worthwhile, don’t be afraid to wear your quirky gaming tastes on your sleeve. You don’t have to pretend to be into the next Call of Duty or Madden if you’d rather be playing weird Japanese visual novels. Or dense PC strategy games. Or candy-colored rhythm games. Or Pokemon Go. Or whatever! If you genuinely love CoD, that’s fine too. The gaming scene is more varied than ever, so you do you.

So, there you go, a few suggested New Year’s resolutions for 2020. Of course, nobody’s forcing you to take my advice! What gaming resolutions will you be making in the new year?",Two young children are eating corndogs,0.1481621

"The New Right Party is on the lookout for some new candidates to add to its electoral list for the upcoming elections who will boost its popularity, including some former members of the Zehut Party. New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",Nobody is playing the guitar,0.1500333

Gaming outlook 2020: A closer look at the numbers

The esports industry is looking to capitalize on a successful 2019 moving into 2020 and beyond.

In its 2019 global games market report, gaming research firm Newzoo states that the international gaming market could be worth US$196 billion by 2022.

Mobile games in particular are projected to generate US$95.4 billion by 2022, driven primarily by smartphone activity. Cross-platform titles such as Mario Kart Tour on iOS and Android, a general increase in smartphone users and improvements to hardware and infrastructure are factors that will lead to the projected growth, according to the firm.

The console segment, on the other hand, is set to reach US$61.1 billion in 2022, Newzoo estimates, boosted by the upcoming generation of Xbox and PlayStation systems, created by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE,TSE:6758), respectively.

PC gaming will be a bit slower in the coming years, according to the researchers, though it is gaining traction and could be valued at US$39.5 billion over the next two year period.

In a previous interview with INN, Erik Dekker, senior vice president and portfolio manager with Dekker Hewett Group at Canaccord Genuity, said, “Gaming is bigger than film box offices, bigger than television, bigger than digital music. I think it’s about a US$116 billion market at this time.”

In esports, organizations like Team Liquid and OG are big generators of cash for the industry. Team Liquid, which has teams in many of the top esports leagues, currently has a merchandise collaboration with Marvel, and OG just announced a Counter Strike: Global Offensive team following its big Dota 2 win.

Team support and attachment have been reflected in the sheer amount of interest in gaming tournaments, another important revenue stream for esport companies.

In August, the Dota 2 The International 9 tournament had the world’s largest prize pool in history at a whopping US$34.3 million in winnings, and OG took home the top prize.

But organizations are evolving to rely on more than just their athletes and tournaments — instead, they’re taking a holistic approach to branding and maintaining a public image.

“It’s going to ultimately come down to teams that can create brand lifestyles, create great content programming and diversify the revenue streams to find more profitability,” Daniel Mitre, CEO of New Wave Esports (CSE:NWES), told INN via email.

Mitre said the impressive growth of the sector has already led heavy hitters in gaming to throw their hats into the ring. The executive explained that companies like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Riot Games, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Tencent (HKEX:0700), have carefully crafted plans attached to their esports franchises and leagues.

“None of this movement around big games, AAA publishers and developers is coming to a slow,” said Mitre. “In fact, it’s just going to start picking up further.”

This sentiment was shared by another expert in gaming who is optimistic about the market’s trajectory.

Haywood Securities investment banker Sean MacGillis said the skill of the gaming industry is in the flexibility of its revenue channels, which include everything from merchandise and ticket sales to advertising and sponsorship revenue.

“The ability to monetize games is an order of magnitude larger than the ability to monetize traditional forms of content,” MacGillis explained.

Gaming outlook 2020: Possible concerns in the new year

Some experts have noted possible pitfalls for the industry, despite its recent levels of success.

For Nick Mersch, associate portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, the biggest risks for the space could come with the hypothetical collapse of the Overwatch League, one of the biggest leagues in the sector. Mersch said a downturn for the league could turn off existing and prospective investors.

“A lot of traditional sports owners wrote huge checks into teams in this league, and if they get burned here it will be difficult to attract capital back to the space,” Mersch told INN.

According to a report from Variety, viewers for the Overwatch League Grand Finals grew by 16 percent in 2019, with the event reaching 1.12 million average viewers.

Mersch said he’s also keeping his eye on the overvaluation that has plagued esports, pointing to a recent Forbes list ranking “the most valuable companies in esports” that still seems to exaggerate the values of some organizations on it, according to the expert.

Other concerns have larger political implications. The ongoing US-China trade war dampened the growth of the sector, according to Trevor Doerksen, CEO of ePlay Digital (CSE:EPY), and could continue to do so into 2020, especially given China’s place as one of the world’s largest hubs for gaming.

In 2019, it was projected that US$36.5 billion was spent on gaming in China, according to Newzoo.

“Geopolitical forces and the US-China trade war muted global collaboration and access to markets, and important data that would help better understand and grow esports in 2019,” said Doerksen.

The executive said there could be better access to content, games and data across both markets if the relationship between the two countries improves in 2020.

Gaming outlook 2020: Investor takeaway

Mersch said moving forward, the most important factor for gaming will be the work done by data firm Nielsen, owned by The Nielsen Company (NYSE:NLSN), in its esports division, which works to get accurate information on engagement and viewership data.

In his view, Nielsen’s work could help close the existing gap between how the industry is growing and how it’s monetizing that growth, Mersch told INN.

“To close this gap, Fortune 500 companies need actionable return of investment metrics in order to justify more (spending) in the space. Nielsen and other data analytic companies can provide this.”

In terms of the overall health within the sector, Mitre told INN that the increasing popularity of gaming and its viewership will help in building a strong foundation for an interesting investment market.

“We’ve always had this propensity to watch people play better than us, whether it’s standing at the arcade and watching someone play Street Fighter, or the emergence of a Twitch and YouTube influencer space watching other people play video games,” said Mitre.

"As India gears up to host the Trumps, US President Donald Trump is on his first official trip to the country along with US First Lady Melania Trump and daughter Ivanka. Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the Ahmedabad International Airport to receive Donald Trump and his family.

The two world leaders will hold a roadshow where a group of 15 students from Sabarmati Gurukulam, will perform Mallakhamba. After this, Modi and Trump will head to Motera Stadium, the world’s largest cricket ground, to take part in the ‘Namaste Trump’ event.

Being aboard the Air Force One flight, the American President is accompanied by a high-level delegation. Grand preparations have been made for the high-profile visit, expecting thousands of people coming to the streets of Ahmedabad to greet Narendra Modi and Donald Trump.

Later on, Trump along with US First Lady Melania will travel Agra to visit Taj Mahal, before arriving in the national capital. In New Delhi, Melania Trump will be visiting the city’s government schools. The two days official visit, 24 and 25 February, is a new seed to strengthen the bilateral relations between the two nations.

A Seadoo is being ridden by a woman,"The New Right Party is on the lookout for some new candidates to add to its electoral list for the upcoming elections who will boost its popularity, including some former members of the Zehut Party. New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",0.19069287

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are coming, some long-awaited titles like The Last of Us Part II and Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally arrive, and cloud gaming and other new ways to play will continue to make inroads. 2020 is going to be a year of transition and upheaval for our hobby, which means it’s a great time for all good little gamers to turn over a new leaf. To make some New Year’s resolutions that will improve your own situation and the gaming scene as a whole.

Of course, sometimes it’s tough to come up with good resolutions, so I’m here to help! Here are a few 2020 gaming resolution suggestions to get your minds percolating…

The Financial Year in Tech 2019: Highs, Lows, and Future Trends

Slim Down Your Backlog in January and February

It’s time to put your pile of shame on a diet. 2020 will eventually see some big releases, with March and April being particularly crazy, but the first two months of the year? Those are unusually barren, so it’s time to finally finish up some of those games that have been lingering for weeks, months, or even years. Personally, I’m finally going to see the end of Red Dead Redemption 2. It, uh, all turns out great, right?

Truly Master at Least One Game

While that aforementioned March-April period will be out of control (get ready for Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 3, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more within the span of weeks) but, overall, 2020 is a transition year. Things will probably be a bit slower than usual, particularly if you don’t pick up a PS4 or Xbox Series X (we’ll talk about that later). That means, instead of increasing your pile of shame, 2020 is a great year to really drill down and master something. Really become good at a fighting or action game or 100 percent that new RPG. It’s more satisfying to master one game than half-finish a half dozen, and your bank account will thank you.

Stop Fighting Steam and Epic’s Battles for Them

Thankfully, it already seems to be dying down a bit, but the Steam vs. Epic Games Store Wars were the most pointless thing we devoted our time to in 2019. These massively-profitable companies don’t need you fighting their battles for them. Downloading an extra launcher is not a huge imposition, and we’re finally starting to see some real, consumer-benefitting competition, with both Steam and Epic offering some great promotions this holiday season.

Arise: A Simple Story Review – A Good Life, A So-So Video Game

I’d say you should all give up your console and NVIDIA vs. AMD wars as well, but I’m trying to keep these resolutions at least somewhat realistic.

Stay Vigilant About Monetization

2019 was the year the loot box died (or least started writing up its Last Will and Testament) and it was regular players speaking up that forced the change. The big publishers certainly wouldn’t have given them up on their own. That said, do keep an eye out for new monetization schemes, because you know certain publishers are diligently working on their next big money-grubbing innovation.

Don’t Buy a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X at Launch

I won’t be sticking to this resolution myself, but if you don’t strictly need a next-gen console for your job like I do, wait a while to buy PS5 or Xbox Series X. Consoles are overpriced at launch and it takes a while before you know if a machine is going to be successful. Also, in most cases, the first great, truly next-gen games don’t come out until about a year into a console’s lifespan. Both the PS5 and XSX are probably going to be around for a while, so sit back, consider your options, and make an informed decision.

Do Buy a Switch if You Haven’t Already

But maybe you have some cash earmarked for a new console just burning a hole in your pocket? Well, if you haven’t already, go ahead and grab yourself a Switch. Yes, it’s not the most powerful machine on the market, but 2019 was the year Nintendo’s little system definitively proved it was more than just a gimmick. The Switch boasts a fantastic library featuring top-notch Nintendo exclusives, the best indies of the past five years, and a handful of surprisingly-solid triple-A ports. I’m a pretty platform-agnostic kind of guy, but this past year most of my gaming free time was spent on the Switch. You might be surprised to find the same thing happening to you.

Don’t Be Jerks to People Who Make the Games You Love

We’re all passionate about his hobby, but that passion can turn into anger when a game or series does something you don’t like. I totally get that, but that said, do keep in mind that games are made by real people, most of whom are just trying their best to make something that will entertain players, so don’t lash out at them. Most of the decisions you’re upset about were probably made by committee in fancy boardrooms, so reserve your anger for publishers, not the rank and file. Also, do try to support devs when stories of crunch or workplace toxicity come out. Happy devs make better games, so better workplace conditions benefit everyone.

Play More Games With Friends

I’ve always believed gaming is at its best when you’re playing with someone close to you on the same couch, or, failing that, a real friend over the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall into the habit of just playing randoms online – to start thinking of the people you’re playing strictly as adversaries instead of friends. A lot of modern games, particularly battle royale stuff, really encourages that. I can guarantee you’ll feel a little better about the hobby, and have to absorb a lot less abuse from trolls, if you make the time to game with friends and family more often.

Try Something New…

As I’ve said, 2020 is a transition year, so why not branch out with something new? Give a genre you’ve never tried a spin, or give one you gave up on long ago another shot. Give that quirky indie a chance. A lot of 2019’s best games were off the regular beaten path, and the same will probably hold true for 2020.

…But Don’t Be Ashamed to Like What You Like

That said, while trying something new is worthwhile, don’t be afraid to wear your quirky gaming tastes on your sleeve. You don’t have to pretend to be into the next Call of Duty or Madden if you’d rather be playing weird Japanese visual novels. Or dense PC strategy games. Or candy-colored rhythm games. Or Pokemon Go. Or whatever! If you genuinely love CoD, that’s fine too. The gaming scene is more varied than ever, so you do you.

So, there you go, a few suggested New Year’s resolutions for 2020. Of course, nobody’s forcing you to take my advice! What gaming resolutions will you be making in the new year?",chinese stocks higher at midday friday,0.22547026

Gaming and the esports industry — characterized by massive video game tournaments — saw unprecedented growth in 2019 as investors recognized opportunity.

Now, heading into 2020, the gaming sector is poised to further shift into a lucrative market as increased interest supports the growth of players in the space.

Here the Investing News Network (INN) turns to experts in the market to get a sense of what’s in store for investors looking to plug into the esports industry in the new year.

Gaming outlook 2020: A closer look at the numbers

The esports industry is looking to capitalize on a successful 2019 moving into 2020 and beyond.

In its 2019 global games market report, gaming research firm Newzoo states that the international gaming market could be worth US$196 billion by 2022.

Mobile games in particular are projected to generate US$95.4 billion by 2022, driven primarily by smartphone activity. Cross-platform titles such as Mario Kart Tour on iOS and Android, a general increase in smartphone users and improvements to hardware and infrastructure are factors that will lead to the projected growth, according to the firm.

The console segment, on the other hand, is set to reach US$61.1 billion in 2022, Newzoo estimates, boosted by the upcoming generation of Xbox and PlayStation systems, created by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE,TSE:6758), respectively.

PC gaming will be a bit slower in the coming years, according to the researchers, though it is gaining traction and could be valued at US$39.5 billion over the next two year period.

In a previous interview with INN, Erik Dekker, senior vice president and portfolio manager with Dekker Hewett Group at Canaccord Genuity, said, “Gaming is bigger than film box offices, bigger than television, bigger than digital music. I think it’s about a US$116 billion market at this time.”

Gaming outlook 2020: The growth of team organizations

In esports, organizations like Team Liquid and OG are big generators of cash for the industry. Team Liquid, which has teams in many of the top esports leagues, currently has a merchandise collaboration with Marvel, and OG just announced a Counter Strike: Global Offensive team following its big Dota 2 win.

Team support and attachment have been reflected in the sheer amount of interest in gaming tournaments, another important revenue stream for esport companies.

In August, the Dota 2 The International 9 tournament had the world’s largest prize pool in history at a whopping US$34.3 million in winnings, and OG took home the top prize.

But organizations are evolving to rely on more than just their athletes and tournaments — instead, they’re taking a holistic approach to branding and maintaining a public image.

“It’s going to ultimately come down to teams that can create brand lifestyles, create great content programming and diversify the revenue streams to find more profitability,” Daniel Mitre, CEO of New Wave Esports (CSE:NWES), told INN via email.

Mitre said the impressive growth of the sector has already led heavy hitters in gaming to throw their hats into the ring. The executive explained that companies like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Riot Games, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Tencent (HKEX:0700), have carefully crafted plans attached to their esports franchises and leagues.

“None of this movement around big games, AAA publishers and developers is coming to a slow,” said Mitre. “In fact, it’s just going to start picking up further.”

This sentiment was shared by another expert in gaming who is optimistic about the market’s trajectory.

Haywood Securities investment banker Sean MacGillis said the skill of the gaming industry is in the flexibility of its revenue channels, which include everything from merchandise and ticket sales to advertising and sponsorship revenue.

“The ability to monetize games is an order of magnitude larger than the ability to monetize traditional forms of content,” MacGillis explained.

Gaming outlook 2020: Possible concerns in the new year

Some experts have noted possible pitfalls for the industry, despite its recent levels of success.

For Nick Mersch, associate portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, the biggest risks for the space could come with the hypothetical collapse of the Overwatch League, one of the biggest leagues in the sector. Mersch said a downturn for the league could turn off existing and prospective investors.

“A lot of traditional sports owners wrote huge checks into teams in this league, and if they get burned here it will be difficult to attract capital back to the space,” Mersch told INN.

According to a report from Variety, viewers for the Overwatch League Grand Finals grew by 16 percent in 2019, with the event reaching 1.12 million average viewers.

Mersch said he’s also keeping his eye on the overvaluation that has plagued esports, pointing to a recent Forbes list ranking “the most valuable companies in esports” that still seems to exaggerate the values of some organizations on it, according to the expert.

Other concerns have larger political implications. The ongoing US-China trade war dampened the growth of the sector, according to Trevor Doerksen, CEO of ePlay Digital (CSE:EPY), and could continue to do so into 2020, especially given China’s place as one of the world’s largest hubs for gaming.

In 2019, it was projected that US$36.5 billion was spent on gaming in China, according to Newzoo.

“Geopolitical forces and the US-China trade war muted global collaboration and access to markets, and important data that would help better understand and grow esports in 2019,” said Doerksen.

The executive said there could be better access to content, games and data across both markets if the relationship between the two countries improves in 2020.

Gaming outlook 2020: Investor takeaway

Mersch said moving forward, the most important factor for gaming will be the work done by data firm Nielsen, owned by The Nielsen Company (NYSE:NLSN), in its esports division, which works to get accurate information on engagement and viewership data.

In his view, Nielsen’s work could help close the existing gap between how the industry is growing and how it’s monetizing that growth, Mersch told INN.

“To close this gap, Fortune 500 companies need actionable return of investment metrics in order to justify more (spending) in the space. Nielsen and other data analytic companies can provide this.”

In terms of the overall health within the sector, Mitre told INN that the increasing popularity of gaming and its viewership will help in building a strong foundation for an interesting investment market.

“We’ve always had this propensity to watch people play better than us, whether it’s standing at the arcade and watching someone play Street Fighter, or the emergence of a Twitch and YouTube influencer space watching other people play video games,” said Mitre.

the man is skiing down a snowy hill .,"The New Right Party is on the lookout for some new candidates to add to its electoral list for the upcoming elections who will boost its popularity, including some former members of the Zehut Party. New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",0.24105196

Gaming and the esports industry — characterized by massive video game tournaments — saw unprecedented growth in 2019 as investors recognized opportunity.

Now, heading into 2020, the gaming sector is poised to further shift into a lucrative market as increased interest supports the growth of players in the space.

Here the Investing News Network (INN) turns to experts in the market to get a sense of what’s in store for investors looking to plug into the esports industry in the new year.

Gaming outlook 2020: A closer look at the numbers

The esports industry is looking to capitalize on a successful 2019 moving into 2020 and beyond.

In its 2019 global games market report, gaming research firm Newzoo states that the international gaming market could be worth US$196 billion by 2022.

Mobile games in particular are projected to generate US$95.4 billion by 2022, driven primarily by smartphone activity. Cross-platform titles such as Mario Kart Tour on iOS and Android, a general increase in smartphone users and improvements to hardware and infrastructure are factors that will lead to the projected growth, according to the firm.

The console segment, on the other hand, is set to reach US$61.1 billion in 2022, Newzoo estimates, boosted by the upcoming generation of Xbox and PlayStation systems, created by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE,TSE:6758), respectively.

PC gaming will be a bit slower in the coming years, according to the researchers, though it is gaining traction and could be valued at US$39.5 billion over the next two year period.

In a previous interview with INN, Erik Dekker, senior vice president and portfolio manager with Dekker Hewett Group at Canaccord Genuity, said, “Gaming is bigger than film box offices, bigger than television, bigger than digital music. I think it’s about a US$116 billion market at this time.”

Gaming outlook 2020: The growth of team organizations

In esports, organizations like Team Liquid and OG are big generators of cash for the industry. Team Liquid, which has teams in many of the top esports leagues, currently has a merchandise collaboration with Marvel, and OG just announced a Counter Strike: Global Offensive team following its big Dota 2 win.

Team support and attachment have been reflected in the sheer amount of interest in gaming tournaments, another important revenue stream for esport companies.

In August, the Dota 2 The International 9 tournament had the world’s largest prize pool in history at a whopping US$34.3 million in winnings, and OG took home the top prize.

But organizations are evolving to rely on more than just their athletes and tournaments — instead, they’re taking a holistic approach to branding and maintaining a public image.

“It’s going to ultimately come down to teams that can create brand lifestyles, create great content programming and diversify the revenue streams to find more profitability,” Daniel Mitre, CEO of New Wave Esports (CSE:NWES), told INN via email.

Mitre said the impressive growth of the sector has already led heavy hitters in gaming to throw their hats into the ring. The executive explained that companies like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Riot Games, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Tencent (HKEX:0700), have carefully crafted plans attached to their esports franchises and leagues.

"EASTENDERS star Jake Wood has poked fun at his Love Island lookalike Ollie Williams.

Fans have been floored by the millionaire's resemblance to the soap Lothario ever since he was announced to be going into the villa earlier this week.

Now the Max Branning actor has acknowledged his doppelganger - and was unable to resist a cheeky jibe about the 23-year-old heir's wealth.

Taking to his Instagram page, 47-year-old Jake shared a popular meme that has been circling social media in recent days.

In the image, the Love Island promotional shot of topless Ollie is twinned with a picture of Jake dressed as suave businessman Max in Albert Square.

Above the pictures it is written: ""Good to see Max from EastEnders going into the villa! #LoveIsland"".

Jake captioned the meme: ""FYI I’m the one on the right who doesn’t own a beach in Cornwall"" alongside two crying with laughter emojis.

The post comes after Ollie told The Sun Online that he could miss out on his £15million inheritance if he has sex on TV.

The blonde hunk's family run the Lanhydrock Estate in Cornwall, and has been warned by his dad to behave himself or face the consequences.

He told us: ""Dad said he would write me out of the will. I said to him, ‘OK, brilliant’.

""Mum was like, ‘Oh my God’.""

Ollie’s Instagram is full of pictures showing off his luxury lifestyle of fancy cars, holidays and yachts.

But Ollie insists he will be keeping his wealth secret from co-stars so he does not attract any gold diggers.

He explained: ""In the past, girls have never known about my money. They’ve never known until I have taken them home.

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are coming, some long-awaited titles like The Last of Us Part II and Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally arrive, and cloud gaming and other new ways to play will continue to make inroads. 2020 is going to be a year of transition and upheaval for our hobby, which means it’s a great time for all good little gamers to turn over a new leaf. To make some New Year’s resolutions that will improve your own situation and the gaming scene as a whole.

Of course, sometimes it’s tough to come up with good resolutions, so I’m here to help! Here are a few 2020 gaming resolution suggestions to get your minds percolating…

The Financial Year in Tech 2019: Highs, Lows, and Future Trends

Slim Down Your Backlog in January and February

It’s time to put your pile of shame on a diet. 2020 will eventually see some big releases, with March and April being particularly crazy, but the first two months of the year? Those are unusually barren, so it’s time to finally finish up some of those games that have been lingering for weeks, months, or even years. Personally, I’m finally going to see the end of Red Dead Redemption 2. It, uh, all turns out great, right?

Truly Master at Least One Game

While that aforementioned March-April period will be out of control (get ready for Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 3, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more within the span of weeks) but, overall, 2020 is a transition year. Things will probably be a bit slower than usual, particularly if you don’t pick up a PS4 or Xbox Series X (we’ll talk about that later). That means, instead of increasing your pile of shame, 2020 is a great year to really drill down and master something. Really become good at a fighting or action game or 100 percent that new RPG. It’s more satisfying to master one game than half-finish a half dozen, and your bank account will thank you.

Stop Fighting Steam and Epic’s Battles for Them

Thankfully, it already seems to be dying down a bit, but the Steam vs. Epic Games Store Wars were the most pointless thing we devoted our time to in 2019. These massively-profitable companies don’t need you fighting their battles for them. Downloading an extra launcher is not a huge imposition, and we’re finally starting to see some real, consumer-benefitting competition, with both Steam and Epic offering some great promotions this holiday season.

Arise: A Simple Story Review – A Good Life, A So-So Video Game

I’d say you should all give up your console and NVIDIA vs. AMD wars as well, but I’m trying to keep these resolutions at least somewhat realistic.

Stay Vigilant About Monetization

2019 was the year the loot box died (or least started writing up its Last Will and Testament) and it was regular players speaking up that forced the change. The big publishers certainly wouldn’t have given them up on their own. That said, do keep an eye out for new monetization schemes, because you know certain publishers are diligently working on their next big money-grubbing innovation.

Don’t Buy a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X at Launch

I won’t be sticking to this resolution myself, but if you don’t strictly need a next-gen console for your job like I do, wait a while to buy PS5 or Xbox Series X. Consoles are overpriced at launch and it takes a while before you know if a machine is going to be successful. Also, in most cases, the first great, truly next-gen games don’t come out until about a year into a console’s lifespan. Both the PS5 and XSX are probably going to be around for a while, so sit back, consider your options, and make an informed decision.

Do Buy a Switch if You Haven’t Already

But maybe you have some cash earmarked for a new console just burning a hole in your pocket? Well, if you haven’t already, go ahead and grab yourself a Switch. Yes, it’s not the most powerful machine on the market, but 2019 was the year Nintendo’s little system definitively proved it was more than just a gimmick. The Switch boasts a fantastic library featuring top-notch Nintendo exclusives, the best indies of the past five years, and a handful of surprisingly-solid triple-A ports. I’m a pretty platform-agnostic kind of guy, but this past year most of my gaming free time was spent on the Switch. You might be surprised to find the same thing happening to you.

Don’t Be Jerks to People Who Make the Games You Love

We’re all passionate about his hobby, but that passion can turn into anger when a game or series does something you don’t like. I totally get that, but that said, do keep in mind that games are made by real people, most of whom are just trying their best to make something that will entertain players, so don’t lash out at them. Most of the decisions you’re upset about were probably made by committee in fancy boardrooms, so reserve your anger for publishers, not the rank and file. Also, do try to support devs when stories of crunch or workplace toxicity come out. Happy devs make better games, so better workplace conditions benefit everyone.

Play More Games With Friends

I’ve always believed gaming is at its best when you’re playing with someone close to you on the same couch, or, failing that, a real friend over the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall into the habit of just playing randoms online – to start thinking of the people you’re playing strictly as adversaries instead of friends. A lot of modern games, particularly battle royale stuff, really encourages that. I can guarantee you’ll feel a little better about the hobby, and have to absorb a lot less abuse from trolls, if you make the time to game with friends and family more often.

Try Something New…

As I’ve said, 2020 is a transition year, so why not branch out with something new? Give a genre you’ve never tried a spin, or give one you gave up on long ago another shot. Give that quirky indie a chance. A lot of 2019’s best games were off the regular beaten path, and the same will probably hold true for 2020.

…But Don’t Be Ashamed to Like What You Like

That said, while trying something new is worthwhile, don’t be afraid to wear your quirky gaming tastes on your sleeve. You don’t have to pretend to be into the next Call of Duty or Madden if you’d rather be playing weird Japanese visual novels. Or dense PC strategy games. Or candy-colored rhythm games. Or Pokemon Go. Or whatever! If you genuinely love CoD, that’s fine too. The gaming scene is more varied than ever, so you do you.

So, there you go, a few suggested New Year’s resolutions for 2020. Of course, nobody’s forcing you to take my advice! What gaming resolutions will you be making in the new year?",0.27400273

"New 2020 is almost upon us and it’s going to be a landmark year for gaming. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are coming, some long-awaited titles like The Last of Us Part II and Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally arrive, and cloud gaming and other new ways to play will continue to make inroads. 2020 is going to be a year of transition and upheaval for our hobby, which means it’s a great time for all good little gamers to turn over a new leaf. To make some New Year’s resolutions that will improve your own situation and the gaming scene as a whole.

Of course, sometimes it’s tough to come up with good resolutions, so I’m here to help! Here are a few 2020 gaming resolution suggestions to get your minds percolating…

The Financial Year in Tech 2019: Highs, Lows, and Future Trends

Slim Down Your Backlog in January and February

It’s time to put your pile of shame on a diet. 2020 will eventually see some big releases, with March and April being particularly crazy, but the first two months of the year? Those are unusually barren, so it’s time to finally finish up some of those games that have been lingering for weeks, months, or even years. Personally, I’m finally going to see the end of Red Dead Redemption 2. It, uh, all turns out great, right?

Truly Master at Least One Game

While that aforementioned March-April period will be out of control (get ready for Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 3, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more within the span of weeks) but, overall, 2020 is a transition year. Things will probably be a bit slower than usual, particularly if you don’t pick up a PS4 or Xbox Series X (we’ll talk about that later). That means, instead of increasing your pile of shame, 2020 is a great year to really drill down and master something. Really become good at a fighting or action game or 100 percent that new RPG. It’s more satisfying to master one game than half-finish a half dozen, and your bank account will thank you.

Stop Fighting Steam and Epic’s Battles for Them

Thankfully, it already seems to be dying down a bit, but the Steam vs. Epic Games Store Wars were the most pointless thing we devoted our time to in 2019. These massively-profitable companies don’t need you fighting their battles for them. Downloading an extra launcher is not a huge imposition, and we’re finally starting to see some real, consumer-benefitting competition, with both Steam and Epic offering some great promotions this holiday season.

Arise: A Simple Story Review – A Good Life, A So-So Video Game

I’d say you should all give up your console and NVIDIA vs. AMD wars as well, but I’m trying to keep these resolutions at least somewhat realistic.

Stay Vigilant About Monetization

2019 was the year the loot box died (or least started writing up its Last Will and Testament) and it was regular players speaking up that forced the change. The big publishers certainly wouldn’t have given them up on their own. That said, do keep an eye out for new monetization schemes, because you know certain publishers are diligently working on their next big money-grubbing innovation.

Don’t Buy a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X at Launch

I won’t be sticking to this resolution myself, but if you don’t strictly need a next-gen console for your job like I do, wait a while to buy PS5 or Xbox Series X. Consoles are overpriced at launch and it takes a while before you know if a machine is going to be successful. Also, in most cases, the first great, truly next-gen games don’t come out until about a year into a console’s lifespan. Both the PS5 and XSX are probably going to be around for a while, so sit back, consider your options, and make an informed decision.

Do Buy a Switch if You Haven’t Already

But maybe you have some cash earmarked for a new console just burning a hole in your pocket? Well, if you haven’t already, go ahead and grab yourself a Switch. Yes, it’s not the most powerful machine on the market, but 2019 was the year Nintendo’s little system definitively proved it was more than just a gimmick. The Switch boasts a fantastic library featuring top-notch Nintendo exclusives, the best indies of the past five years, and a handful of surprisingly-solid triple-A ports. I’m a pretty platform-agnostic kind of guy, but this past year most of my gaming free time was spent on the Switch. You might be surprised to find the same thing happening to you.

Don’t Be Jerks to People Who Make the Games You Love

We’re all passionate about his hobby, but that passion can turn into anger when a game or series does something you don’t like. I totally get that, but that said, do keep in mind that games are made by real people, most of whom are just trying their best to make something that will entertain players, so don’t lash out at them. Most of the decisions you’re upset about were probably made by committee in fancy boardrooms, so reserve your anger for publishers, not the rank and file. Also, do try to support devs when stories of crunch or workplace toxicity come out. Happy devs make better games, so better workplace conditions benefit everyone.

Play More Games With Friends

I’ve always believed gaming is at its best when you’re playing with someone close to you on the same couch, or, failing that, a real friend over the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall into the habit of just playing randoms online – to start thinking of the people you’re playing strictly as adversaries instead of friends. A lot of modern games, particularly battle royale stuff, really encourages that. I can guarantee you’ll feel a little better about the hobby, and have to absorb a lot less abuse from trolls, if you make the time to game with friends and family more often.

Try Something New…

As I’ve said, 2020 is a transition year, so why not branch out with something new? Give a genre you’ve never tried a spin, or give one you gave up on long ago another shot. Give that quirky indie a chance. A lot of 2019’s best games were off the regular beaten path, and the same will probably hold true for 2020.

…But Don’t Be Ashamed to Like What You Like

That said, while trying something new is worthwhile, don’t be afraid to wear your quirky gaming tastes on your sleeve. You don’t have to pretend to be into the next Call of Duty or Madden if you’d rather be playing weird Japanese visual novels. Or dense PC strategy games. Or candy-colored rhythm games. Or Pokemon Go. Or whatever! If you genuinely love CoD, that’s fine too. The gaming scene is more varied than ever, so you do you.

So, there you go, a few suggested New Year’s resolutions for 2020. Of course, nobody’s forcing you to take my advice! What gaming resolutions will you be making in the new year?",the battery is in an open path to the bulb .,0.32710266

While HDFC Bank, IndusIndia Bank, RIL, Tata, SBI gained, leading tech stocks were trading in the red.

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex rebounded nearly 500 points in opening session on Tuesday as global investors calmed on no further escalation in the mid-east tensions.

After hitting a high of 41,135.47, the 30-share BSE index was trading 450 points or 1.11 per cent higher at 41,126.63. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rallied 132.25 points or 1.10 per cent to 12,125.30.

HDFC Bank was the gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying up to 2.16 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, Relinace Industries, Tata Steel, SBI and Axis Bank.

On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech were trading in the red.

In the previous session, the 30-share gauge ended at 40,676.63, dropping of 787.98 points, or 1.90 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty closed at 11,993.05, falling by 233.60 points, or 1.91 per cent.

Meanwhile, on a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 103.84 crore, and domestic institutional investors offloaded shares worth Rs 23.70 crore on Monday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

According to traders, domestic investors followed Asian stocks that rebounded after a day of no escalation in the US-Iran tussle.

The Pentagon on Monday distanced itself from U.S. President Donald Trump’s assertions that he would bomb Iranian cultural sites despite international prohibitions on such attacks.

Following the news, Brent crude futures fell 1.20 per cent to USD 68.08.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul were trading in the green.

Exchanges on Wall Street too ended on a positive note on Monday.

Fans have been floored by the millionaire's resemblance to the soap Lothario ever since he was announced to be going into the villa earlier this week.

Now the Max Branning actor has acknowledged his doppelganger - and was unable to resist a cheeky jibe about the 23-year-old heir's wealth.

Taking to his Instagram page, 47-year-old Jake shared a popular meme that has been circling social media in recent days.

In the image, the Love Island promotional shot of topless Ollie is twinned with a picture of Jake dressed as suave businessman Max in Albert Square.

Above the pictures it is written: ""Good to see Max from EastEnders going into the villa! #LoveIsland"".

Jake captioned the meme: ""FYI I’m the one on the right who doesn’t own a beach in Cornwall"" alongside two crying with laughter emojis.

The post comes after Ollie told The Sun Online that he could miss out on his £15million inheritance if he has sex on TV.

The blonde hunk's family run the Lanhydrock Estate in Cornwall, and has been warned by his dad to behave himself or face the consequences.

He told us: ""Dad said he would write me out of the will. I said to him, ‘OK, brilliant’.

""Mum was like, ‘Oh my God’.""

Ollie’s Instagram is full of pictures showing off his luxury lifestyle of fancy cars, holidays and yachts.

But Ollie insists he will be keeping his wealth secret from co-stars so he does not attract any gold diggers.

He explained: ""In the past, girls have never known about my money. They’ve never known until I have taken them home.

Meet Love Island 2020 contestant Ollie Williams

""I’m not a snob. And I don’t brag. I’m very humble and understated.

""The only way you find out is when you come down the drive. They see the estate and go, ‘What the f***’.

""It is the kind of reaction I get and it can be quite fun.""

Love Island returns to our screens this Sunday 12 January, with other confirmed contestants including Rochelle Humes' lookalike sister and Lewis Capaldi's ex.","Fans were quick to point out the similarities between the actor and the newest Islander

EastEnders star Jake Wood has laughed off comments which claim he's the 'spitting image' of Love Island newbie, Ollie Williams.

Earlier this week, TV fans couldn’t help but notice the Max Branning actor’s resemblance to the posh islander Ollie.

Finally acknowledging the similarities, Jake shared a hilarious Instagram post which included a meme which has been circulating on Twitter .

""Good to see Max from EastEnders going into the villa! #LoveIsland"".

And 47-year-old Jake cheekily added: ""FYI I’m the one on the right who doesn’t own a beach in Cornwall"" with two laughing faces.

This comes after the 23-year-old revealed that he could face losing his £15 million inheritance if he has sex on the ITV2 dating series.

The Love Island contestant is heir to the Lanhydrock Estate in Cornwall, and is set to take over his father's title of Lord of the Manor of Lanhydrock.

Before entering the villa, he admitted his dad Andrew would be furious if he ever got frisky on-screen.

He told The Sun : ""Initially, Dad said he would write me out of the will,” admitted Ollie.

""He was jesting, of course. But as the process got more and more serious Dad is saying, ‘if you get through, I hope you take me to South Africa with you’. He is now on board.""

Ollie, who has never watched Love Island, admitted his mother is more of a fan.

""Mum is huge addict of the show,"" he said. ""Dad has been forced to watch the odd episode.""

Ollie said of the estate: ""The house and the gardens are bequeathed to the National Trust. We live behind the house as a family. In the 1950s, it became very difficult to run a historic house fully staffed. And that’s the only real way to keep it alive.

""So it’s preserved as it was when we left it and we can still use it for functions and family parties. Our family home is not small. It’s called The Old Vicarage. It does the job. We don’t have any staff – apart from your regular cleaner.""

Ollie, who claimed he is a changed man after cheating on his previous girlfriend of four years several times, applied for the show after growing tired with life and work on the estate.

He admitted he keeps his vast fortune quiet when he starts dating a girl.

""In the past, girls have never known about my money – until I have taken them home,"" he said. ""I’m not a snob. And I don’t brag. I’m very humble and understated.
