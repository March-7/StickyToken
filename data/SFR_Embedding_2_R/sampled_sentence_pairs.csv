BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

"BHOPAL: As many as 8 lakh employees of BHEL, Railways, Post Office, BSNL, Banks, Income Tax, CPWD and others stood at par with the nationwide strike by 10 trade unions against privatisation and mergering of banks, in Bhopal on Wednesday.

Demonstration and march (procession) marked the strike in the state capital. Bankers demonstrated at Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Press Complex, impacting banking services in the region.

They also put up 12-point demands including minimum wage of Rs 21,000 and pension of Rs 10,000 among all departments.

The National Open Mass Convention of Workers organised by the ten Central Trade Unions namely INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, independent federations and associations of various sectors including some independent unions called for a nationwide general strike against the anti-worker, anti people, anti-national policies of the Modi-2 Government.

Western central Railways (WCR) Employees Union Philip Oommen said, “We have supported the strike on the basis of demands which are well justified. We hold demonstration to extend moral support to strike which was against central government anti-employees policies.”

INTUC (BHEL) president RD Tripathi said, “All the trade unions were on strike in BHEL in response to the nationwide strike call against central government anti-employees policies. It was big strike against union government.”

All India Postal Department Employees Association general secretary RN Parashar said, “It was successful nationwide strike against union government anti-employees policies especially economic policies. Employees from all the branches joined the strike.”

As per protesters, the national economy is slowing down. The adverse effects are already being felt by the workers in unorganised as well as organised sectors in the form of large scale retrenchment and closures. In the name of the recession, the Central Government is taking steps such as reducing corporate taxes, and giving them big bonanza from the national exchequer while not a single penny is spent to ensure job security or employment allowance to the workers.",A person is playing a piano.,0.24554268

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state's directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.

Michigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.

FDA OKs EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF DRUGS TOUTED BY TRUMP TO FIGHT COVID-19

But last week, Whitmer’s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to “administrative action” should they continue to use the medication.

“The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has received multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to themselves, family, friends, and/or coworkers without a legitimate medical purpose,” Deb Gagliardi, the director of the Bureau of Professional Licensing, and Forrest Pasanski, the director of the Enforcement Division, wrote in a letter to “licensed prescribers and dispensers.”

“Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage” for those patients who need the drug for its approved use, adding that “reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action.

“Again, these drugs have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.”

“Michigan pharmacists may see an increased volume of prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and should take special care to evaluate the prescriptions’ legitimacy,” they continued, warning again that “licensed health professionals are required to report inappropriate prescribing practices.”

Michigan wasn’t the only state last week to threaten physicians using the drugs—Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak’s administration also restricted the prescription of the medication, after a man died and his wife was hospitalized for using a fish tank cleaning additive with a similar name as a substitute.

""While the two drugs have necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada's own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said in a statement last week.

But Michigan reversed course, requesting a supply of the medications for physicians to use in treating patients of COIVD-19, after the Department of Health and Human Services received and accepted donations of the medications to the national stockpile to be used for coronavirus treatment.

“President Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. “Scientists in America and around the world have identified multiple potential therapeutics for COVID-19, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.”

He added: “The President’s bold leadership and the hard work of FDA and HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response have succeeded in securing this large donation of medicine. We’ll continue working around the clock to get American patients access to therapeutics that may help them battle COVID-19, while building the evidence to evaluate which options are effective.”

The FDA’s emergency use authorization allows hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the national stockpile “to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.”

WHITMER SAYS STATES ARE IN A BIDDING WAR OVER MEDICAL SUPPLIES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate are oral prescription drugs approved to treat malaria and other diseases. HHS says there currently are no approved treatments for COVID-19, but that both drugs have “shown activity in laboratory studies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).”

“Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” HHS said in a statement. “Clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.”

Meanwhile, Whitmer, who has been a fierce critic of the president, said last week that states are being forced to bid with one another for personal protective equipment (PPE) and, in some cases, contracts in place have been set aside, delayed or canceled and the goods are instead going to the federal government.

“We the states are trying to actively get every piece of PPE that we can. We're bidding against one another and, in some cases, the federal government is taking priority,” she said.

Whitmer added: “We've got to keep working to get all of these other pieces of equipment and when we're bidding against one another, it's creating a lot of frustration and concern.”

As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 216,700 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 5,130 deaths.

Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state's directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.

Michigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.

FDA OKs EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF DRUGS TOUTED BY TRUMP TO FIGHT COVID-19

But last week, Whitmer’s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to “administrative action” should they continue to use the medication.

“The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has received multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to themselves, family, friends, and/or coworkers without a legitimate medical purpose,” Deb Gagliardi, the director of the Bureau of Professional Licensing, and Forrest Pasanski, the director of the Enforcement Division, wrote in a letter to “licensed prescribers and dispensers.”

“Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage” for those patients who need the drug for its approved use, adding that “reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action.

“Again, these drugs have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.”

“Michigan pharmacists may see an increased volume of prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and should take special care to evaluate the prescriptions’ legitimacy,” they continued, warning again that “licensed health professionals are required to report inappropriate prescribing practices.”

Michigan wasn’t the only state last week to threaten physicians using the drugs—Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak’s administration also restricted the prescription of the medication, after a man died and his wife was hospitalized for using a fish tank cleaning additive with a similar name as a substitute.

""While the two drugs have necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada's own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said in a statement last week.

But Michigan reversed course, requesting a supply of the medications for physicians to use in treating patients of COIVD-19, after the Department of Health and Human Services received and accepted donations of the medications to the national stockpile to be used for coronavirus treatment.

“President Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. “Scientists in America and around the world have identified multiple potential therapeutics for COVID-19, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.”

He added: “The President’s bold leadership and the hard work of FDA and HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response have succeeded in securing this large donation of medicine. We’ll continue working around the clock to get American patients access to therapeutics that may help them battle COVID-19, while building the evidence to evaluate which options are effective.”

The FDA’s emergency use authorization allows hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the national stockpile “to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.”

WHITMER SAYS STATES ARE IN A BIDDING WAR OVER MEDICAL SUPPLIES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate are oral prescription drugs approved to treat malaria and other diseases. HHS says there currently are no approved treatments for COVID-19, but that both drugs have “shown activity in laboratory studies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).”

“Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” HHS said in a statement. “Clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.”

Meanwhile, Whitmer, who has been a fierce critic of the president, said last week that states are being forced to bid with one another for personal protective equipment (PPE) and, in some cases, contracts in place have been set aside, delayed or canceled and the goods are instead going to the federal government.

“We the states are trying to actively get every piece of PPE that we can. We're bidding against one another and, in some cases, the federal government is taking priority,” she said.

Whitmer added: “We've got to keep working to get all of these other pieces of equipment and when we're bidding against one another, it's creating a lot of frustration and concern.”

As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 216,700 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 5,130 deaths.

Two rockets hit the Green Zone in Iraq's capital of Baghdad, a day after Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. and other coalition targets at bases in Iraq, according to a report Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared gains on the heels of the reports of an explosion in Baghdad. The Dow Jones closed 161 points higher, but about 80 points lower than it had been just before the news.

Iraq's military said that two Katyusha rockets fell inside the Green Zone, the section that contains the U.S. Embassy, other embassies of western nations and foreign businesses, according to Reuters.

There were no casualities, according to the statement from Iraq's military.

The White House and Pentagon had no immediate comment.

The rockets were fired several hours after President Donald Trump declared that Iran appeared to be standing down from the U.S. — remarks that sent stock indices surging higher.

On Tuesday night eastern time, Iran fired missile attacks against two Iraqi bases that house U.S. military and coalition forces.

The barrage was retaliation for the killing a week earlier of Iran's top military leader, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, in an U.S. airstrike in Baghdad.

"Vision:



Build long-standing institutional affiliations that promote democracy with nations currently developing democratic civilian and military institutions.

Mission:

The Office of International Affairs provides the Adjutant General and Joint Forces Headquarters staff advice and policy recommendations on international initiatives for the California National Guard. This includes the Security Cooperation components of the National Security Strategy and National Military Strategy aspects of international relations activities conducted by the California National Guard.



The Office of International Affairs manages the State Partnership Program (SPP) with Ukraine. The SPP deploys California National Guard teams to Ukraine and brings Ukrainians to the United States for information sharing to assist Armed Forces of Ukraine in re-structuring, modernizing its forces, and strengthening principles of democracy and free market economies. Exchanges include information about the processes underpinning US military structures that result in subordination to civilian control, consensus building, methodologies for achieving objectives, and interagency coordination of civil/military issues. Future missions for International Relations will include partnerships with other countries to bring the same philosophy to these regions of the world as has been done successfully in the Baltics.



Along with California many other state National Guards are providing bilateral engagement partnerships with their partnered nation. As the program evolves, it is becoming a sophisticated security cooperation tool of US National Security Strategy which brings together civilian expertise, multi-level government agencies, NATO, non-government organizations and commercial interests to address social, economic, military and political issues such as border security, base conversion, emergency response, interagency cooperation, civil-military relations and security cooperation.

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

"BHOPAL: As many as 8 lakh employees of BHEL, Railways, Post Office, BSNL, Banks, Income Tax, CPWD and others stood at par with the nationwide strike by 10 trade unions against privatisation and mergering of banks, in Bhopal on Wednesday.

Demonstration and march (procession) marked the strike in the state capital. Bankers demonstrated at Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Press Complex, impacting banking services in the region.

They also put up 12-point demands including minimum wage of Rs 21,000 and pension of Rs 10,000 among all departments.

The National Open Mass Convention of Workers organised by the ten Central Trade Unions namely INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, independent federations and associations of various sectors including some independent unions called for a nationwide general strike against the anti-worker, anti people, anti-national policies of the Modi-2 Government.

Western central Railways (WCR) Employees Union Philip Oommen said, “We have supported the strike on the basis of demands which are well justified. We hold demonstration to extend moral support to strike which was against central government anti-employees policies.”

INTUC (BHEL) president RD Tripathi said, “All the trade unions were on strike in BHEL in response to the nationwide strike call against central government anti-employees policies. It was big strike against union government.”

All India Postal Department Employees Association general secretary RN Parashar said, “It was successful nationwide strike against union government anti-employees policies especially economic policies. Employees from all the branches joined the strike.”

As per protesters, the national economy is slowing down. The adverse effects are already being felt by the workers in unorganised as well as organised sectors in the form of large scale retrenchment and closures. In the name of the recession, the Central Government is taking steps such as reducing corporate taxes, and giving them big bonanza from the national exchequer while not a single penny is spent to ensure job security or employment allowance to the workers.",group must be in equilibrium .,0.35886934

"Vision:



Build long-standing institutional affiliations that promote democracy with nations currently developing democratic civilian and military institutions.

Mission:

The Office of International Affairs provides the Adjutant General and Joint Forces Headquarters staff advice and policy recommendations on international initiatives for the California National Guard. This includes the Security Cooperation components of the National Security Strategy and National Military Strategy aspects of international relations activities conducted by the California National Guard.



The Office of International Affairs manages the State Partnership Program (SPP) with Ukraine. The SPP deploys California National Guard teams to Ukraine and brings Ukrainians to the United States for information sharing to assist Armed Forces of Ukraine in re-structuring, modernizing its forces, and strengthening principles of democracy and free market economies. Exchanges include information about the processes underpinning US military structures that result in subordination to civilian control, consensus building, methodologies for achieving objectives, and interagency coordination of civil/military issues. Future missions for International Relations will include partnerships with other countries to bring the same philosophy to these regions of the world as has been done successfully in the Baltics.



Along with California many other state National Guards are providing bilateral engagement partnerships with their partnered nation. As the program evolves, it is becoming a sophisticated security cooperation tool of US National Security Strategy which brings together civilian expertise, multi-level government agencies, NATO, non-government organizations and commercial interests to address social, economic, military and political issues such as border security, base conversion, emergency response, interagency cooperation, civil-military relations and security cooperation.



Numerous future reciprocal events will continue to strengthen the cooperation and understanding that both governments now enjoy. Of the several benefits SPP provides, one major contribution will continue to be the security and welfare of both our citizens.",british grandmother sentenced to death for smuggling cocaine into bali,0.3684447

"not a direct answer to the question , but something to consider .","The residents of T. Nagar, have made a request to the Greater Chennai Corporation to re-locate a trash

disposal point, located on Guild Street, T. Nagar. Residents say the disposal point is nothing short of a trash

yard. Though, steps are taken to clear the garbage every day, either in the night or early in the morning, the

conservancy staff collect and dispose the trash from residential apartments and homes and other commercial

establishments in the vicinity for the conservancy truck staff to clear the garbage.

On days, the garbage is spilled on to the roads affecting free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. To add to

the woes of the pedestrians, especially women, men relieve themselves in the open. Of late, the space near

the trash yard has become a parking slot.

“In the mornings and evenings, countless number of pedestrians walk through the stretch to reach the railway

terminal and a couple of educational institutions. Stray dogs roam in large numbers on the stretch, creating a

fear in the minds of the pedestrians. We have complained several times in this regard to the authorities

concerned in the GCC to re-locate the dumping point. But, no action, has been taken till date. We are being

asked by the authorities concerned to re-locate a trash disposal point,"" residents say.

Besides, while clearing the trash from the disposal point, the walls of a prestigious educational institution

located on the stretch have been damaged by the conservancy vehicle for fifth time in a row. A similar

situation prevails on Police Quarters Road.

Despite, a washroom near the T. Nagar bus terminus, men relive in the open on the stretch, making it horrible to commute through the stretch to gain access to bus terminus, residents, add.",0.52085614
