More accurately, all four of the No. 1 seeds waltzed into the third round of the Big Dance, one of them at the expense of the Bay Area’s only entry in the field, Saint Mary’s. The Gaels were crushed Sunday 87-56 by Baylor, the top seed in the South Regional.

Gonzaga also breezed, beating Oklahoma 88-70 to join Kansas and Dayton, both of which advanced Saturday. The four top seeds won by an average of 20.5 points.

Only one Cinderella remains in the field — 10th-seeded Utah State, which won Saturday against No. 2 Florida State — but the Aggies almost got company Sunday. East Tennessee State, a 14-seed that had knocked off Seton Hall in the first round, gave BYU all it could handle before falling 100-97.

Two 7-seeds advanced Sunday as Arizona and Providence ended the dreams of UC-Irvine and North Dakota State, respectively, a pair of 15th-seeded bracket busters who had knocked out San Diego State and Kentucky on Thursday.

The Providence victory gave the Big East three teams in the Sweet 16. Five leagues have two; Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, ACC and the West Coast Conference. Rounding out the field are the SEC (Auburn), the Atlantic-10 (Dayton), and the Mountain West (Utah State).

Here’s the Day 4 roundup of games:

SOUTH REGIONAL

No. 1 Baylor 87, No. 8 Saint Mary’s 56>> The Gaels’ season came to an agonizingly slow end. They fell behind early, trailed by 18 at half and by 33 with 11:44 to play. It was their worst loss since a 94-46 embarrassment at Gonzaga in February 2019. Butler (28-4) was led in scoring, as it has been all season, by its trio of guards. Davion Mitchell 20 points), MaCio Teague (17) and Jared Butler (15), none of whom had shot better than 42% during the regular season, all shot better than 50%.

Jordan Ford, wrapping up a four-year career that could put his No. 3 in the rafters at Saint Mary’s, scored 24 points, but nobody else was in double figures. Malik Fitts, who made seven 3-pointers in the first-round victory over Rutgers, had only seven points. The Gaels (27-9) shot poorly from everywhere: 3 of 16 from behind the arc, nine of 15 from the free throw line, and 36.7% overall. (We did not attempt to reach coach Randy Bennett after this one.)

No. 6 Virginia 63, No. 3 Michigan State 59>> The Cavaliers, who run-and-gunned their way to a season-high 82 points in the opening round (25 points over their season average) returned to character. With its slow-paced offense and smothering defense, Virginia held MSU to 25 first-half points, limiting the Spartans to 19 shots, seven of which they blocked, and forcing seven turnovers. Still, the Spartans had a chance to tie the game with 11 seconds left, but Rocket Watts missed a wide-open three from the corner and Virginia sealed the outcome with two free throws from Jay Huff. Mamadi Diakite had 21 points and eight rebounds for the UVA (25-7) and Braxton Key added 13 points and 13 rebounds. MSU (23-10) was led by three players with 11 points, including Xavier Tillman, who also had 11 rebounds.

No. 2 Creighton 76, No. 7 Illinois 69 >>- The Bluejays, the only surviving 2-seed in the tournament, trailed by 11 points in the second half and were down 65-59 with 4:16 to play. But they closed the game on a 17-4 run during which they held Illinois scoreless on eight consecutive possessions. Denzel Mahoney came off the bench for 17 points to lead Creighton (26-7). Damien Jefferson had 15 and Ty-Shon Alexander and Marcus Zegarowski added 12 apiece. Kofi Cockburn had 16 points and 10 rebounds to lead Illinois (22-10).

WEST REGIONAL

No. 1 Gonzaga 88, No. 9 Oklahoma 70>> Cory Kispert led six players in double figures and the Zags broke open a close game midway through the second half. An 8-2 run — the first six points coming from Joel Ayayi –turned a 50-45 lead into an 11-point lead and the Sooners never got back within 10. Kispert had 17 points, Filip Petrusev had 12, and four others had 11, including Ayayi. Austin Reaves scored 17 to lead Oklahoma (20-13).

No. 6 BYU 100, No. 14 Eastern Washington 97>> Zac Seljaas’ 3-point shot from the right wing broke a 93-93 tie with 1:37 to play, Andy Toolson followed with another three and the Cougars escaped the upset-minded Eagles from the Big Sky Conference. BYU made 13 of 22 three-point attempts (59.1%) and shot almost 60% overall (40 of 67) and then held its collective breath as a last-second shot by EWU circled the rim twice before spinning out. TJ Haws (26 points, 12 assists) and Yoeli Childs (26 points, 11 rebounds) led the way for BYU. Jacob Davison had 29 points for EWU (24-9).

No. 7 Arizona 89, No. 15 UC-Irvine 66>> Zeke Nnaji had 18 points and 17 rebounds as the Wildcats put an early end to the Anteaters’ hope of pulling another upset. UC-Irvine, which shocked No. 2 seed San Diego State on Friday, led 17-16 after a 3-pointer by Jeron Artest (son of Ron Artest). But Arizona answered with a bucket and two free throws from Max Hazzard (grandson of the late Walt Hazzard) and the Wildcats led the rest of the way. Tony Rutherford had 15 points for UCI (22-11). Arizona’s Nico Mannion led all scorers with 19.

MIDWEST REGIONAL

No. 3 Duke 98, No. 14 East Tennessee State 89>> The upstarts from the Southern Conference, who had stunned Seton Hall in the opener, jumped out to a 7-1 lead. And that’s where Duke put a stop to things. The Blue Devils caught the Eagles at 16, passed them on a tip-in by Javin DuLaurier and never trailed after a 10-0 run put them ahead 49-39. ETU, winners of 13 straight, pulled within 78-75, but then went cold for almost six minutes as Duke rebuilt its lead to 13 and coasted into Sweet 16 for the 16th time in 20 years. Vernon Carey led the Blue Devils with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Tre Jones, playing amid rumors that he will apply for the NBA draft, had 16 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Cassius Stanley also had 16 points. Patrick Good had 22 for ETU, which finished the season 31-4.

No. 7 Providence 104, No. 15 North Dakota State 57>> The Friars jumped on the team that had KO’d Kentucky two days earlier, scoring the first seven points en route to a 20-5 lead. Providence led 51-33 at halftime and didn’t let up, outscoring the Bison 53-24 in the second half. Luwane Pipkins led six Friars in double figures with 19 points, hitting 5 of 7 treys. Alpha Diallo added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Rocky Kreuser had 16 to lead North Dakota State (26-9), which had won 13 of its previous 14 games.",0.0981637

Pulisic was back in Chelsea manager Frank Lampard's XI for the Premier League's first match of 2020, the Blues' 1-1 away draw at Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday.

🔵🇺🇸👀Christian Pulisic watch: How did #USMNT star perform on his return to the Chelsea starting lineup v. Brighton? @JPW_NBCSports has minute-by-minute analysis on the #CFC winger ⤵️ https://t.co/Cl3pFbsys6 pic.twitter.com/qGM0y2MfMX — NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) January 1, 2020

Deployed wide left in Lampard's 4-2-3-1, Pulisic went 66 minutes and left the game with his side in the lead on Cesar Aspilicueta's 10th-minute goal. Brighton eventually leveled the match through Alireza Jahanbaksh's spectacular equalizer, an overhead kick from range.

Lampard had ruled Pulisic out of Chelsea's previous match, a 2-1 come-from-behind win away at London rivals Arsenal, and there appeared to be concerns that a hamstring or groin ailment could keep the winger out several weeks.

However, Pulisic took to Twitter to reveal, at the very least, those concerns were overblown.

Wednesday's draw marked Chelsea's fourth match and the end of a typically busy league stretch over the holiday season. Their next match comes Sunday home to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round before returning to league play on Jan. 11 at home against Burnley.",0.1545908

Hotel megabrand heiress, reality TV star, singer — she’s kind of done it all. Now Paris is the focus of a brand new YouTube documentary, This Is Paris.

As you might suspect, the documentary focuses on Paris herself as she grapples with establishing a new identity and brand for herself while accepting how many in the public see her. Paris is most notoriously known as one of the stars of The Simple Life, a reality show that first aired in 2003. Costarring Nicole Richie, the show followed the two children of celebrities as they navigated rural life.

On her role in the show, Paris explained to People, “I knew what I was doing but the whole world didn’t, so it was kind of frustrating to me to be perceived in that way because it’s not who I am at all. But it was such an amazing and entertaining show that I would just think of it as entertainment.”",0.17818847

"Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister

Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister

In a major announcement during her Budget 2020 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharamam said State-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was set to go public. Ms. Sitharaman on Saturday said the Narendra Modi government plans to sell a part of its stake in the entity through an initial public offering (IPO) and raise funds.

Sitharaman, however, did not give details such as what percentage of holding would be sold or when it would take place. Listing of companies on stock exchanges “discipline a company and provides access to financial markets and unlocks its value. It also gives (an) opportunity for retail investors to participate in the wealth so created,” she said.

The government owns 100% stake in LIC, which was set up in 1956 and remains the country’s largest state-run insurer. LIC increased its share of the first-year premium income in the first nine months of this fiscal, rising to 70.52% from 66.24% recorded in 2018-19. According to Bloomberg estimates, its assets roughly equal $433 billion (over ₹30 lakh crore).

"Nnamdi Kanu, leader the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has hinted at not returning to Nigeria for his parents’ funeral scheduled ...





Nnamdi Kanu, leader the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has hinted at not returning to Nigeria for his parents’ funeral scheduled for Friday.





In a broadcast via London-based Radio Biafra at the weekend, the IPOB leader said he is monitoring developments on the event in Abia state from abroad.





Kanu also said the ceremony would be broadcast live.





The IPOB leader has been on the run since 2017 when soldiers raided his father’s residence in Abia.





IPOB was later declared a terrorist group, and a federal high court in Abuja, where Kanu was being tried for alleged treason, ordered his arrest after he jumped bail.





Reacting to the police’ statement that they would disrupt the burial ceremony if IPOB members attend the event, Kanu said the “whole world will be watching” on that day.





“Instead of them to be remorseful for causing the death of my father and mother, all they are saying is we will come and shoot at people that attend the burial,” he said.





“They should come and shoot; our CCTV is there live… so that when it starts, they won’t deny it.





“It will be relayed live so that when our people’s madness starts, they won’t go back to propaganda and say, ‘it is secession, they are trying to secede.”





Ene Okon, Abia commissioner of police, had said the funeral of Eze Kanu and his wife, king and queen of Afaraukwu (Nnamdi Kanu’s community), would not take place with the presence of IPOB members.





“I have already reached out to the traditional prime minister of Afaraukwu (Nnamdi Kanu’s community) and told him that if they want the burial to go smoothly and for police to give them security, they should tell IPOB not to near the area not to talk of participating in the burial,” the commissioner said.",A man on a bike is jumping on a pyramid-shaped ramp,0.22948949

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",0.23154151

Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what’s to come. It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

It's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol
