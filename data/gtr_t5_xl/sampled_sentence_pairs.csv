"New Delhi: Senior IAS officer Rajiv Bansal was Thursday named the CMD of national carrier Air India. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet approved Bansal;s appointment as CMD of Air India in the rank and pay of an Additional Secretary.

At present, Bansal, a 1988 batch officer of the Nagaland cadre, held the post of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. He succeeds Ashwani Lohani. In August 2017, he was given the additional charge as Air India’s CMD.

Bansal has had an earlier stint with the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) between 2006 and 2008.

Now Bansal will have his task cut out as the government is going for 100% disinvestment of the national career. Very soon the government will put up Air India for sale. The move is being opposed by 14 unions of Air India. So Bansal will have to handle everything carefully.

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.","cricket-england 155-4 v australia , fourth test - tea",0.40437737

"Researchers have found that combining neurologic and blood pressure drugs may reduce breast tumour development.

According to the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, adding a medication used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraines to a blood pressure medicine reversed some aspects of breast cancer in the offspring of mice at high risk of the disease because of the high fat diet fed to their mothers during pregnancy.

""We believe that our research is the first to show that we can reverse some aspects of increased breast cancer risk found in offspring of mouse mothers fed a high fat diet during pregnancy,"" said study researcher Leena A Hilakivi-Clarke from the Georgetown University in the US.

""This finding may have important implications in people because exposures in the womb to certain chemicals, or a mother's high fat diet, or being obese, can subsequently increase a daughter's breast cancer risk,"" Hilakivi-Clarke.

According to the researchers, the key drug in the study regimen was valproic acid which, among several targets, inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), an important epigenetic silencer of genes.

In contrast to mutations that permanently disrupt the normal functions of genes, epigenetic modifications are reversible.

Valproic acid was combined with the blood pressure medication hydralazine that inhibits another critical epigenetic regulator, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).

Early treatment studies in people have shown that these two drugs can work in tandem to disrupt tumour growth.

These research findings demonstrate how impactful an epigenetic methyl group addition or subtraction from DNA can be.

Compounds that reduce methylation of tumour suppressor genes that are excessively methylated (hypermethylated) can be beneficial.

However, these drugs can have the opposite effect if tumour suppressor genes are not hypermethylated; they may remove methyl groups from cancer-causing genes, making these genes more active and potentially leading to more aggressive cancers.

The other key aspect of this finding involves the potential impact of diet on cancer risk. Many fruits and vegetables have compounds (such as flavones) that chemically react in the same ways as the HDAC- and DNMT-inhibiting drugs in this study.

Some compounds in these foods, especially folic acid, have opposite effects.

This research suggests that exposure to a high fat diet or endocrine disrupting chemicals in the womb might be reversed by the consumption of foods high in DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, while those who have not had such exposures might also gain a cancer protective benefit from consuming foods high in folic acid.

The scientists noted, however, that their findings, particularly as they relate to diet, need to be studied in people.

""Our next step will be to try to identify biomarkers in humans that indicate an exposure in the womb to diets or endocrine disrupting chemicals that could increase breast cancer risk later in life,"" said Hilakivi-Clarke.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.",mob kills man for burning quran,0.48053378

"Researchers have found that combining neurologic and blood pressure drugs may reduce breast tumour development.

According to the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, adding a medication used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraines to a blood pressure medicine reversed some aspects of breast cancer in the offspring of mice at high risk of the disease because of the high fat diet fed to their mothers during pregnancy.

""We believe that our research is the first to show that we can reverse some aspects of increased breast cancer risk found in offspring of mouse mothers fed a high fat diet during pregnancy,"" said study researcher Leena A Hilakivi-Clarke from the Georgetown University in the US.

""This finding may have important implications in people because exposures in the womb to certain chemicals, or a mother's high fat diet, or being obese, can subsequently increase a daughter's breast cancer risk,"" Hilakivi-Clarke.

According to the researchers, the key drug in the study regimen was valproic acid which, among several targets, inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), an important epigenetic silencer of genes.

In contrast to mutations that permanently disrupt the normal functions of genes, epigenetic modifications are reversible.

Valproic acid was combined with the blood pressure medication hydralazine that inhibits another critical epigenetic regulator, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).

Early treatment studies in people have shown that these two drugs can work in tandem to disrupt tumour growth.

These research findings demonstrate how impactful an epigenetic methyl group addition or subtraction from DNA can be.

Compounds that reduce methylation of tumour suppressor genes that are excessively methylated (hypermethylated) can be beneficial.

However, these drugs can have the opposite effect if tumour suppressor genes are not hypermethylated; they may remove methyl groups from cancer-causing genes, making these genes more active and potentially leading to more aggressive cancers.

The other key aspect of this finding involves the potential impact of diet on cancer risk. Many fruits and vegetables have compounds (such as flavones) that chemically react in the same ways as the HDAC- and DNMT-inhibiting drugs in this study.

Some compounds in these foods, especially folic acid, have opposite effects.

This research suggests that exposure to a high fat diet or endocrine disrupting chemicals in the womb might be reversed by the consumption of foods high in DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, while those who have not had such exposures might also gain a cancer protective benefit from consuming foods high in folic acid.

The scientists noted, however, that their findings, particularly as they relate to diet, need to be studied in people.

""Our next step will be to try to identify biomarkers in humans that indicate an exposure in the womb to diets or endocrine disrupting chemicals that could increase breast cancer risk later in life,"" said Hilakivi-Clarke.

President Trump had a fiery exchange with CNN analyst and Playboy reporter Brian Karem during the coronavirus press briefing in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, where he announced that the U.S. was halting its funding of the World Health Organization (WHO) for its errors leading up to the coronavirus pandemic.

""I know you want to blame the WHO, but I've spoken to hundreds of people across the country in the last few weeks,"" Karem began. ""They say they still can't get tested and they're not social distancing because --""

""So the governors,"" Trump interjected, ""I know your question. You ready? The governors, the governors are supposed to do testing. It's up to the governors.""

As Trump went to move on to the next reporter's question, Karem continued shouting his question.

""Quiet, quiet,"" Trump scolded the reporter. ""The governors are doing the testing. It's now not up -- and it hasn't been up -- to the federal government.""

The president called on the next reporter, but Karem persisted on asking his question, which was disrupting the press conference.

""I told them when they put this guy here, it's nothing but trouble,"" Trump said about Karem. ""He's a showboat. If you keep talking, I'll leave and you can have it out with the rest of these people. If you keep talking, I'm going to leave and you can have it out with them.""

""It's just a simple question,"" Karem said.

""Just a loudmouth,"" Trump fired back.

"Identical twin sisters who had worked as nurses at the same hospital died within days of each other after testing positive for coronavirus.

Katy and Emma Davis, 37, both suffered from underlying health conditions and had been unwell for some time before contracting Covid-19.

Tributes were paid to the pair after Katy died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday and Emma died early on Friday morning.

Their sister Zoe Davis told the BBC: “They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well.

“There are no words to describe how special they were.”

Katy worked as risk and patient safety lead in child health at University Hospital Southampton (UHS), while Emma was a nurse in the colorectal unit for nine years until 2013.

Paula Head, chief executive at UHS, said: “I want to pay tribute to Katy who sadly passed away on Tuesday.

“Katy has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her.

UHS said that Emma had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19.

“She sadly also passed away last night and it goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them,” a spokesperson said.​

They added: “Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader.

“She was well liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us.

“We are supporting Katy and Emma’s family as much as we can through this difficult and distressing period.”

At least 90 front line NHS workers, including around 50 nurses, are believed to have died during the coronavirus outbreak.

"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Presidential candidate Tom Steyer says he is hoping that when Democrats meet on a debate stage Tuesday, they focus less on arguing over nondisclosure agreements and personal wealth, and more on taking on President Donald Trump. The investor and activist qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, which holds its primary Saturday.

Steyer’s comment highlights the backlash faced by the other billionaire Democratic candidate in the race, Michael Bloomberg, over his history of having at least three former female employees sign nondisclosure agreements related to alleged offensive comments he made. During the last debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pointedly criticized Bloomberg for the agreements and accused him of buying his way onto the stage through a blitz of political advertising.

Steyer, who didn’t qualify for the last debate, told the PBS NewsHour that spending time discussing nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.

“The attitude you have towards women matters,” Steyer said. “If you could show that there was something really wrong, that really matters. But something that says, ‘There could have been something wrong,’ and they have a nondisclosure agreement– I don’t think that rises to the level of a presidential debate.”

Steyer said he felt that Trump “won” the last debate because “people spent their time talking about minor, irrelevant points to try and tear each other down, when in fact the real question is, what you are going to do for the American people that’s different and better?”

After Steyer poured millions of dollars of his own personal wealth into running ads and hiring campaign staff in South Carolina, he said he, too, expects to be attacked by some candidates over his affluence.

“I’m not going to apologize for being a success,” Steyer said. “If I were a person who is totally self-absorbed and selfish, then I’d have something to be embarrassed about. I’m not embarrassed about starting a business, succeeding in a business and using everything I can to try and work for the American people. That’s exactly what I’m doing.”

Early on in its history, his hedge fund invested in fossil fuels and private prisons– two sectors criticized by many Democrats. When asked if those investments were a mistake, Steyer affirmed that it was, and that he had corrected it on his own by disinvesting in those industries. “I really care about these issues,” he said, adding that attacks based on that history “are low political blows.”

A poll released Monday by NBC news and Marist shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading in South Carolina with 27 percent of support. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, currently seen as the Democratic front-runner, is just four points behind. Steyer is in third place with 15 percent.

WATCH: Buttigieg vows to focus on diversity ahead of South Carolina

To Steyer, criticism of his spending in South Carolina is offensive to the black voters who make up the majority of Democratic primary voters in the state — and with whom he has made inroads.

“We’re out here renting rooms and hiring people to work,” Steyer said of his campaign operation. “Every time somebody hires a black person and they go into a community, somehow that’s buying influence. No one ever says that when you go and hire white people.”

Steyer said that “the implication is that black people are there to be bought and that we’re trying to do it, that’s not true,” he said. “That’s what you do when you organize politically. You get people from the community, you hire staff in the community so you can work in the community.”",what is the difference between a filler word and a discourse marker ?,0.542917

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.","New Delhi: Senior IAS officer Rajiv Bansal was Thursday named the CMD of national carrier Air India. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet approved Bansal;s appointment as CMD of Air India in the rank and pay of an Additional Secretary.

At present, Bansal, a 1988 batch officer of the Nagaland cadre, held the post of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. He succeeds Ashwani Lohani. In August 2017, he was given the additional charge as Air India’s CMD.

Bansal has had an earlier stint with the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) between 2006 and 2008.

Now Bansal will have his task cut out as the government is going for 100% disinvestment of the national career. Very soon the government will put up Air India for sale. The move is being opposed by 14 unions of Air India. So Bansal will have to handle everything carefully.

"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Presidential candidate Tom Steyer says he is hoping that when Democrats meet on a debate stage Tuesday, they focus less on arguing over nondisclosure agreements and personal wealth, and more on taking on President Donald Trump. The investor and activist qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, which holds its primary Saturday.

Steyer’s comment highlights the backlash faced by the other billionaire Democratic candidate in the race, Michael Bloomberg, over his history of having at least three former female employees sign nondisclosure agreements related to alleged offensive comments he made. During the last debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pointedly criticized Bloomberg for the agreements and accused him of buying his way onto the stage through a blitz of political advertising.

Steyer, who didn’t qualify for the last debate, told the PBS NewsHour that spending time discussing nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.

“The attitude you have towards women matters,” Steyer said. “If you could show that there was something really wrong, that really matters. But something that says, ‘There could have been something wrong,’ and they have a nondisclosure agreement– I don’t think that rises to the level of a presidential debate.”

Steyer said he felt that Trump “won” the last debate because “people spent their time talking about minor, irrelevant points to try and tear each other down, when in fact the real question is, what you are going to do for the American people that’s different and better?”

After Steyer poured millions of dollars of his own personal wealth into running ads and hiring campaign staff in South Carolina, he said he, too, expects to be attacked by some candidates over his affluence.

“I’m not going to apologize for being a success,” Steyer said. “If I were a person who is totally self-absorbed and selfish, then I’d have something to be embarrassed about. I’m not embarrassed about starting a business, succeeding in a business and using everything I can to try and work for the American people. That’s exactly what I’m doing.”

Early on in its history, his hedge fund invested in fossil fuels and private prisons– two sectors criticized by many Democrats. When asked if those investments were a mistake, Steyer affirmed that it was, and that he had corrected it on his own by disinvesting in those industries. “I really care about these issues,” he said, adding that attacks based on that history “are low political blows.”

A poll released Monday by NBC news and Marist shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading in South Carolina with 27 percent of support. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, currently seen as the Democratic front-runner, is just four points behind. Steyer is in third place with 15 percent.

To Steyer, criticism of his spending in South Carolina is offensive to the black voters who make up the majority of Democratic primary voters in the state — and with whom he has made inroads.

“We’re out here renting rooms and hiring people to work,” Steyer said of his campaign operation. “Every time somebody hires a black person and they go into a community, somehow that’s buying influence. No one ever says that when you go and hire white people.”

Steyer said that “the implication is that black people are there to be bought and that we’re trying to do it, that’s not true,” he said. “That’s what you do when you organize politically. You get people from the community, you hire staff in the community so you can work in the community.”","but the bureau never kept tabs on al-bayoumi — despite receiving prior information he was a secret saudi agent , the report says .",0.5866649

blast kills 10 young girls in eastern afghanistan,"Identical twin sisters who had worked as nurses at the same hospital died within days of each other after testing positive for coronavirus.

Katy and Emma Davis, 37, both suffered from underlying health conditions and had been unwell for some time before contracting Covid-19.

Tributes were paid to the pair after Katy died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday and Emma died early on Friday morning.

Their sister Zoe Davis told the BBC: “They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well.

“There are no words to describe how special they were.”

Katy worked as risk and patient safety lead in child health at University Hospital Southampton (UHS), while Emma was a nurse in the colorectal unit for nine years until 2013.

Paula Head, chief executive at UHS, said: “I want to pay tribute to Katy who sadly passed away on Tuesday.

“Katy has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her.

UHS said that Emma had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19.

“She sadly also passed away last night and it goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them,” a spokesperson said.​

They added: “Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader.

“She was well liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us.

“We are supporting Katy and Emma’s family as much as we can through this difficult and distressing period.”

At least 90 front line NHS workers, including around 50 nurses, are believed to have died during the coronavirus outbreak.

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.","Identical twin sisters who had worked as nurses at the same hospital died within days of each other after testing positive for coronavirus.

Katy and Emma Davis, 37, both suffered from underlying health conditions and had been unwell for some time before contracting Covid-19.

Tributes were paid to the pair after Katy died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday and Emma died early on Friday morning.

Their sister Zoe Davis told the BBC: “They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well.

“There are no words to describe how special they were.”

Katy worked as risk and patient safety lead in child health at University Hospital Southampton (UHS), while Emma was a nurse in the colorectal unit for nine years until 2013.

Paula Head, chief executive at UHS, said: “I want to pay tribute to Katy who sadly passed away on Tuesday.

“Katy has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her.

UHS said that Emma had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19.

“She sadly also passed away last night and it goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them,” a spokesperson said.​

They added: “Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader.

“She was well liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us.

“We are supporting Katy and Emma’s family as much as we can through this difficult and distressing period.”

At least 90 front line NHS workers, including around 50 nurses, are believed to have died during the coronavirus outbreak.
