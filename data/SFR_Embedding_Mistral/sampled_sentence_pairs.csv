A dog is having fun with a toy,"Saudi Arabia will enforce a round-the-clock nationwide curfew during the five-day Eid al-Fitr holiday later this month to fight the coronavirus, the interior ministry said Tuesday, as infections spike.

The kingdom, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in the Gulf region, is scrambling to limit the spread of the deadly disease.

A full lockdown will be reimposed around the country from May 23-27, the ministry said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. The period coincides with the Muslim festival that marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

Most parts of the kingdom were put under full lockdown following the outbreak, but last month the government relaxed the curfew between the hours of 9am and 5pm.

Malls and retailers have been allowed to reopen, except in major hotspots including the holy city of Mecca -- where confirmed cases have soared, despite a stringent lockdown.

The health ministry said Tuesday the number of COVID-19 deaths had risen to 264 and confirmed infections to 42,925, while 15,257 people have recovered.

In March, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round ""umrah"" pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading in Islam's holiest cities.

Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year's hajj -- scheduled for late July -- but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage.

Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once during their lifetime.

The Arab world's biggest economy has also closed cinemas and restaurants and halted flights as it attempts to contain the virus.

"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",A dog is having fun with a toy,0.25889355

Tesla CEO Elon Musk today announced that the company has made its millionth Tesla electric car, some 12 years after it released the Roadster for consumers.

Musk posted a photo of a red Model Y Tesla on Twitter announcing the milestone along with a group shot of the Tesla Factory workers responsible for manufacturing it. Musk's announcement was first reported by Electrek.

Congratulations Tesla team on making our 1,000,000th car!! pic.twitter.com/5M99a9LLQi — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2020

The Model Y will be Tesla's fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report.

Tesla reported that it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year.

Tesla is expecting deliveries in 2020 to exceed 500,000 units and for production to outstrip deliveries thanks to Model 3 production in Shanghai and Model Y production in Fremont, California. Model Y production in Shanghai is scheduled for 2021.

Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 400,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 150,000 Model 3 cars per year.

It's also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021.

Musk today suggested the Berlin Gigafactory should have a ""mega rave cave"" under the facility with an ""epic sound systems & woofers the size of a car"".

Tesla should have a mega rave cave under the Berlin Gigafatory — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2020

Given Musk's taste for audacious publicity stunts, there's a chance he could build a Tesla underground club in a nod to Berlin's rave culture.

Musk posted the one million Tesla production milestone a few hours after Tesla shares fell 13.6% to $608 per share as investors fretted over oil output increases announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia this week. The prospect of cheaper petrol over the long term could dampen enthusiasm for electric vehicles in general.

The other major concern is the impact of the COVID-19 virus on Tesla's Shanghai plant, which the Chinese government ordered to be shut for 10 days from 29 January.

Thor has just become more powerful than ever before. Jason Aaron's years-long Thor run has come to a dramatic close, and it's time for a fresh beginning for the God of Thunder. Aaron ended with Thor regaining his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, and taking the throne of the All-Father of Asgard.

Step forward Donny Cates, who's becoming one of Marvel's most prolific writers and the architect of all their cosmic plots. The first issue of Cates' Thor relaunch sees the God of Thunder prepare to give a speech to his people, one that's interrupted by the untimely arrival of Galactus, dying after exposure to a cosmic force known as the Great Black Winter.

According to Galactus, the Great Black Winter has revealed that Thor is destined to be his death. As a result, operating under the principle of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Galactus appoints Thor Odinson as his new Herald, transforming him with the Power Cosmic. In the Directors' Cut, Cates describes the transformation like this:

Thor rises, and he has been remade. His arm is back, as is his eye, and his hair is now LONG. Like down to his butt long. Like the nineties Thor that I love. He's also wearing a slick new costume, very sci-fi and slick. Mostly black and bright white. The white on his costume should be glowing like lightning. And the black should be made of a star field. His eyes glow as well. Crackling with energy. His hammer, a solid Mjolnir-shaped bolt of lightning. He has become cosmic-Zeus! His run sigil emblazoned on his chest. Smoke pouring off him.

This is easily the most phenomenal power-up Thor has ever received. He's never exactly been a weakling, but now he possesses all the power of the God of Thunder; wields an enchanted hammer containing a God Tempest that can destroy entire star systems; has been granted the power of the All-Father himself; and also wields the Power Cosmic, meaning he should have all the powers of any other Herald of Galactus. He's officially the strongest Avenger, the mightiest god in any of Marvel's Pantheons, and the greatest Herald ever to serve Galactus.

Donny Cates is a smart writer. That means he wouldn't have given Thor this level of power if he didn't have a story in mind that would demand it. What's more, in interviews Cates has insisted he still sees Thor as a young god, a flawed man given to fits of temper and in danger of being overcome by his own ego and pride. Galactus' prophecy - foretelling that the God of Thunder will, in fact, be the one responsible for his own destruction - suggests that Thor Odinson may well not be able to handle the vast, unfathomable powers that are now at his disposal. Will absolute power corrupt absolutely?

A man is playing guitar.,"Not all hospitals around the UK are banning new fathers and visitors from the maternity rooms, although some have brought in heavy restrictions amid the lockdown

Why Boris Johnson was allowed at the birth of his baby with fiancee Carrie Symonds

The Prime Minister is said to have been able to be at his fiancee's side as she gave birth to their first child together despite the lockdown.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many hospitals are only allowing one birth partner for the duration of labour and delivery, while homebirth services have temporarily been suspended.

Boris Johnson was able to be present at the birth just days after he was cleared to leave hospital after falling ill with Covid-19 himself - because the NHS hospital where his fiancee gave birth does allow dads to attend.

At some hospitals, fathers have been told not to attend pregnancy scans or maternity units, as hospitals bring in restrictions to halt the spread of coronavirus

Hospitals are allowed to bring in their own rules, meaning some have been more strict than others about visitors in birthing rooms during lockdown.

Some maternity units have brought in tight restrictions, as pregnant women are listed among the most vulnerable groups urged to take special precautions during the pandemic.

The couple's son has been named Wilfred Lawrence Nicholas Johnson, with his middle name a tribute to the St Thomas' Hospital doctors the PM credits with saving his life.

Wilfred was born elsewhere, at University College London Hospital (UCLH), where one person is allowed in to accompany women as they give birth during lockdown.

The hospital's advice to expectant mothers says they will have to give birth in an isolation room if they have tested positive for Covid-19.

Some staff would wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if expectant mother has the virus, UCLH's advice says.

The 55-year-old leader's fiancee Carrie Symonds, 32, had already had to self-isolate with symptoms of the virus before she gave birth.

While scientists are still working to understand Covid-19, many experts say it appears patients cannot be infected more than once.

Researchers are working on antibody tests that will be able to tell who has already had coronavirus in hopes working out who may already be immune can help Britain ease out of lockdown.

As Mr Johnson returned to the Downing Street helm last week, his partner and her baby were declared healthy and well after the birth.

A delighted Ms Symonds posted a picture of herself on Instagram last week cradling her first child, saying she “couldn’t be happier” and that her “heart is full”.

“Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am,"" she wrote.

""Wilfred after Boris’ grandfather Lawrie after my grandfather Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart – the two doctors that saved Boris’ life last month.

“Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well. I couldn’t be happier. My heart is full.”

UCLH chief executive Professor Marcel Levi said: “Congratulations to Carrie Symonds and prime minister Boris Johnson on the birth of their son. We wish them every happiness at this special time.

“I would like to thank the teams who cared for Carrie and her baby. They are an incredibly skilled, dedicated and compassionate group of professionals who put patients at the heart of everything they do.

""I am very proud of them and all our staff at UCLH who are working extremely hard in very difficult circumstances at the moment.”",0.31639987

Thor has just become more powerful than ever before. Jason Aaron's years-long Thor run has come to a dramatic close, and it's time for a fresh beginning for the God of Thunder. Aaron ended with Thor regaining his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, and taking the throne of the All-Father of Asgard.

Step forward Donny Cates, who's becoming one of Marvel's most prolific writers and the architect of all their cosmic plots. The first issue of Cates' Thor relaunch sees the God of Thunder prepare to give a speech to his people, one that's interrupted by the untimely arrival of Galactus, dying after exposure to a cosmic force known as the Great Black Winter.

According to Galactus, the Great Black Winter has revealed that Thor is destined to be his death. As a result, operating under the principle of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Galactus appoints Thor Odinson as his new Herald, transforming him with the Power Cosmic. In the Directors' Cut, Cates describes the transformation like this:

Thor rises, and he has been remade. His arm is back, as is his eye, and his hair is now LONG. Like down to his butt long. Like the nineties Thor that I love. He's also wearing a slick new costume, very sci-fi and slick. Mostly black and bright white. The white on his costume should be glowing like lightning. And the black should be made of a star field. His eyes glow as well. Crackling with energy. His hammer, a solid Mjolnir-shaped bolt of lightning. He has become cosmic-Zeus! His run sigil emblazoned on his chest. Smoke pouring off him.

This is easily the most phenomenal power-up Thor has ever received. He's never exactly been a weakling, but now he possesses all the power of the God of Thunder; wields an enchanted hammer containing a God Tempest that can destroy entire star systems; has been granted the power of the All-Father himself; and also wields the Power Cosmic, meaning he should have all the powers of any other Herald of Galactus. He's officially the strongest Avenger, the mightiest god in any of Marvel's Pantheons, and the greatest Herald ever to serve Galactus.

Donny Cates is a smart writer. That means he wouldn't have given Thor this level of power if he didn't have a story in mind that would demand it. What's more, in interviews Cates has insisted he still sees Thor as a young god, a flawed man given to fits of temper and in danger of being overcome by his own ego and pride. Galactus' prophecy - foretelling that the God of Thunder will, in fact, be the one responsible for his own destruction - suggests that Thor Odinson may well not be able to handle the vast, unfathomable powers that are now at his disposal.

There is no child holding a camera in front of his face,"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump went off on the Democrats and their attempts to turn the 2020 election into an all-mail-in affair, complete with all of the opportunities fraudsters needs to tilt the results any way they might choose.

“There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,” tweeted the president. “Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed.”

Instead of giving Trump space to air his opinions and predictions about this scheme, Twitter took it upon themselves to throw their objectivity away and slap a “fact check” label on the tweet. This label linked to a paragraph assuring users that there was “no evidence” of widespread fraud connected to mail-in voting, all but suggesting that the president is lying to the American people.

Predictably, this raised Trump’s ire. “@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post.”

In addition to sticking their noses in where they aren’t wanted and don’t belong, Twitter actually made a fool of themselves by trying to “fact check” the president.

First of all, since this is the first tweet that they’ve done this to, we assume that every single thing that Trump has written up till this Tuesday is 100% true. That certainly goes against what his critics in the mainstream media have been saying for the last four years.

Second, Twitter is endangering their status as a “platform,” which gives them all kinds of liability protections that would not be available to them if they were deemed a “publisher.” Right now, Twitter is exempt from defamation and libel lawsuits based on what people on their platform say. They aren’t responsible for what’s written there. But if they’re going to wade into the fray and start labeling posts true and false, then that may change in a hurry.

Finally, if Twitter is going to fact-check the President of the United States, they should probably make sure they have their facts straight. In 2005, a bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform found that “absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud” in the United States. Just this week, in fact, the Alabama secretary of State confirmed that 83% of the voter fraud his state has seen in the last five years has come from mail-in ballots.

Maybe it’s too much to ask that Twitter fact-check their fact-checks. And, to be clear, we’re actually NOT asking them to do so. We’d much prefer they go back to minding their own business and letting people do their own research. But if they want to take on this burden, they need to be prepared. So far, they’ve only succeeded in embarrassing themselves.",0.4000442

"NEW DELHI: The restrictions imposed by the army on its personnel and formations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is posing challenges to its internal functioning.Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties. While this is also affecting the training routines of troops, reduction in attendance at the headquarters is set to slow down other work as well, said officials.The steps are aimed at ensuring social distancing and preventing contagion. It has created an unprecedented situation, forcing the army to improvise, especially because troops eat, sleep and train together within confined spaces. For example, one particular unit has now divided troops into teams that live in different areas, while ensuring that only one team uses the common toilets at a time. Training is conducted in small batches, and the equipment is sanitised every time it is used.The army on Monday issued fresh instructions to all its military stations, cantonments, units and formations in the 82 districts under lockdown. These include restricted movements, functioning of only those personnel engaged in essential services and the closure of all CSD canteens Officials said the reduction in manpower in some of the army’s formations was due to the extension of leave of soldiers till April 15 and placing those who recently returned on quarantine. Those who are going on leave due to an emergency in their families will be sent for a minimum period of 30 days. “We are in a situation where we are slightly less in strength. It affects day-to-day functioning, administrative and security duties. There is an increase in the workload of those on guard duties, because there is less turnover of troops,” an official said.The manpower also gets affected because troops are tasked with manning the quarantine facilities setup by the army. However, officials said the situation was not “alarming”, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army’s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept. Last week, the army passed instructions that 35% officers and 50% junior commissioned officers (JCO) and other ranks (OR) would work from home for a week from Monday, while the next group would do this starting March 30. The lockdown in Delhi is also affecting the travel of those personnel who stay in Gurgaon and Uttar Pradesh.“Work at the headquarters has slowed, as we are working with bare essentials. The deadline for work such as submitting reports will be extended. Only emergency work will continue as it was,” an official said.The army’s complaints section for now will only be dealing with cases that are urgent. Officials said rosters had been created to divide the staff between those who work at home and those who come to the office. However, it remains to be seen what work will be given to those working from home, because files cannot be taken home due to confidentiality issues. Several issues also cannot be communicated over email due to cybersecurity threats. Moreover, JCOs and ORs are mainly clerks who are part of the filing system for letters and documents, which can be done only from the offices.Officials said training of troops had also reduced. However, this will not affect operational preparedness, because it is for a short duration and can be made up later.In relation to the unit mentioned earlier, training of troops has become more “concentrated”, because smaller batches are being trained. “This has given us an opportunity to train better. Training small groups ensures that everyone’s doubts are cleared and attention is given to each aspect. But due to the pandemic, we have to sanitise an equipment every time it is used,” an official said.This type of training comes after troops were divided into small teams that maintained a distance of 200 metre between each other. It is also being ensured that distances are being maintained between troops of a team. “Only one team can use a bathroom at a time. After the team is done, the bathroom is sanitised and only then can the other team use it. We also have separate timings for eating at the cookhouse for the teams,” the official said.A major concern for the army stations and cantonments, which are isolated areas in a city, is the civilian manpower that is coming from outside. For example, washing points and blow drying of clothes have been setup outside the gates of one of the cantonments for this manpower.","that said , i would caution against the attempted use of proof by anecdote here to prove the effectiveness and validity of the concealed carry laws .",0.46695697

"Tesla Autopilot death: Final report blames Tesla, Apple, and NHTSA Watch Now

Tesla CEO Elon Musk today announced that the company has made its millionth Tesla electric car, some 12 years after it released the Roadster for consumers.

Musk posted a photo of a red Model Y Tesla on Twitter announcing the milestone along with a group shot of the Tesla Factory workers responsible for manufacturing it. Musk's announcement was first reported by Electrek.

Congratulations Tesla team on making our 1,000,000th car!! pic.twitter.com/5M99a9LLQi — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2020

The Model Y will be Tesla's fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report.

Tesla reported that it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year.

Tesla is expecting deliveries in 2020 to exceed 500,000 units and for production to outstrip deliveries thanks to Model 3 production in Shanghai and Model Y production in Fremont, California. Model Y production in Shanghai is scheduled for 2021.

Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 400,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 150,000 Model 3 cars per year.

It's also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021.

Musk today suggested the Berlin Gigafactory should have a ""mega rave cave"" under the facility with an ""epic sound systems & woofers the size of a car"".

Tesla should have a mega rave cave under the Berlin Gigafatory — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2020

Given Musk's taste for audacious publicity stunts, there's a chance he could build a Tesla underground club in a nod to Berlin's rave culture.

Musk posted the one million Tesla production milestone a few hours after Tesla shares fell 13.6% to $608 per share as investors fretted over oil output increases announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia this week. The prospect of cheaper petrol over the long term could dampen enthusiasm for electric vehicles in general.

The other major concern is the impact of the COVID-19 virus on Tesla's Shanghai plant, which the Chinese government ordered to be shut for 10 days from 29 January.

"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.
