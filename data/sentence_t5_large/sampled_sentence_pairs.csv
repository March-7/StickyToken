West Bengal Republic Day tableau: Twenty-two proposals, 16 from states and union territories and six from central ministries — out of a total 56 have been short-listed for this Republic Day parade, the Defence Ministry said on Wednesday.

The Ministry had received 32 tableau proposals from states and union territories and 24 from central ministries and departments.

“Out of these, 22 proposals, comprising 16 states/UTs and 6 ministries/departments, have finally been short-listed for participation in the Republic Day Parade 2020 after a series of five meetings,” a statement by the ministry said.

The West Bengal government’s proposal was rejected after an Expert Committee examined it in two rounds of meeting, it said.

“The tableau proposal of the West Bengal government was not taken forward for further consideration by the Expert Committee after deliberations in the second meeting.

“It is pertinent to mention here that the tableau of the Government of West Bengal was short-listed for participation in the Republic Day Parade 2019 as an outcome of the same process,” it added.

There is a well-established system for selection of tableau for participation in the Republic Day Parade. The Ministry of Defence invites proposals from all states, union territories, central ministries and departments.

The proposals are then evaluated in a series of meetings of the Expert Committee comprising eminent persons in the fields of art, culture, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, choreography, etc.

The Committee examines the proposals on the basis of theme, concept, design and its visual impact before making its recommendations, the statement said.

Due to time constraints, only a limited number of tableau can be short-listed for participation in the parade. “The selection process in vogue, leads to participation of the best tableau in the parade,” the statement added.",0.6006324

"As our communities deal with the spread of the coronavirus, federal leaders must take bold steps to ensure the safety of the public, particularly the most vulnerable among us. While this virus will hit communities regardless of race, income, or zip code, this pandemic will cause both health and economic disruptions that exacerbate the existing disparities for low-income people and communities of color that have long harmed our nation.

CALL YOUR SENATOR



Please call your senators and ask them to pass the emergency House bill to help us navigate this public health and economic crisis.

Early Saturday morning, the House passed an emergency bill that would allocate billions of dollars for paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing, and other measures to help those impacted by this crisis. This is a necessary starting point that the Senate must pass now.

Unfortunately, these measures are narrow in scope, leaving 80 percent of workers unprotected. While some large employers are doing the right thing and giving employees sick leave, a national policy is the most effective measure in this time of unprecedented national crisis. We need comprehensive legislation to follow this initial bill to protect all people, especially those with the greatest health and economic risks.

We Need Comprehensive Public Health and Economic Supports



Today, 100 million people — one in three people in the US — live in or on the brink of poverty where an illness, job loss, or unexpected expense can be financially insurmountable. At a time when officials are urging the public to stay home when they fall ill, millions of people lack paid sick leave and can’t afford to miss work to care for themselves or a loved one. This puts many people at risk for being the vector of an illness that can prove deadly for the elderly and immunocompromised. And as businesses take precautions or are forced through social-distancing norms to close, the resulting loss of income for workers and owners will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and risk their housing, health, utility, and food security.

We must plan and act with the most vulnerable in mind to both stop the spread of this virus, and ensure that weeks and months of addressing this public health crisis don’t turn into years of economic hardship.

Specifically, we are calling on federal leaders to champion the following policies:

Pass a Paid Leave Policy for All Workers – Low-wage workers who cannot afford to lose a day's wages because of illness are less likely to seek medical care (for themselves and for their families) than workers who do have paid sick leave, and are 1.5 times more likely to go to work with contagious illnesses. This means that lack of paid sick leave is not only a problem for individual workers, but also a public health threat. Building on the House-passed version, a paid sick leave policy that covers all workers is urgently needed to address the new coronavirus outbreak and beyond to help protect the health and safety of the population.

Ensure Emergency Income During Work Disruptions – We need to provide guaranteed income to help those facing disruptions to their income due to lost opportunities, funding streams, or customers. This includes small business owners and their employees, community-serving nonprofits, freelancers and artists, and workers in a gig economy who are not eligible for unemployment benefits but still must make their rent or mortgage payments.

Place a Moratorium on All Evictions and Foreclosures and Ensure Housing Stability – We are in the midst of a housing crisis – We are in the midst of a housing crisis where 21 million renters and 17 million homeowners pay more than a third of their income on housing bills, making them extremely vulnerable to income disruptions. We need a moratorium on all evictions and foreclosures to prevent the economic fallout of the virus. We must also provide emergency housing vouchers for all unhoused people, and those facing eviction. And at a minimum, we need to stop displacing homeless encampments, and take measures to increase access to water, hand-washing stations, and sanitation at current encampments to support critical health outcomes.

Prevent Utility Shut-Offs and Restore Water Service to All Households – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. Over a third of US households are already at risk of inability to pay rising water bills. This is particularly concerning as washing our hands is our first line of defense against the virus. All public and private utilities should halt any utility shut-offs during this crisis, restore service to households currently experiencing a shutoff, and provide water delivery to all households with contaminated water systems.

Ensure Hospitals and Health-Care Centers Are Safe Places for Immigrants and Anyone Seeking Care – We must eliminate all barriers to people seeking proper medical attention, regardless of insurance or lack thereof. This also includes ensuring no one’s immigration status will be questioned when seeking assistance. Hospitals and health-care facilities must make it clear in all languages that immigration status will not be questioned, and should take steps to ensure immigration enforcement officials are not permitted in buildings.

Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 Through the Incarcerated Population – In the US, – In the US, 2.3 million people are exposed to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in prisons and jails, which will contribute to the spread of the coronavirus as the incarcerated population interacts with staff and other visitors. At a minimum, we must ensure incarcerated people have access to medical care and personal hygiene products; release elderly people with underlying medical problems to parole supervision; and release those who have an anticipated release date in 2020 and 2021 to parole supervision.

We are heartened by the swift actions that leaders in cities across the country are taking, proving once again that local leaders are national leaders. But we need policymakers at all levels to urgently address the threat of this current pandemic while ensuring we protect all struggling communities beyond this crisis.

"When it came to souping up Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty lingerie for Valentine’s Day 2020, the self-professed bad gal had one designer in mind: Adam Selman, aka the man whose Le Specs collaboration took the modelling world by storm. The Hadid sisters and Kendall Jenner are Selman fans, and RiRi – who gives seriously good sunglasses – has worn her friend’s shades despite designing pairs herself over at Fenty.com. So, does Selman have the same magic touch when it comes to underwear?

“Lingerie is something I’ve always wanted to design,” Selman tells Vogue. “So many of my collections have been influenced and inspired by the detailing and fabrics. It was an easy pairing because Rihanna and I share so many core beliefs: our brands make people feel confident, powerful and joyful.”

The Xclusive 19-piece underwear edit is split into two categories: Locket Down and Down The Aisle. The former is a play on words, but is as literal as it gets, according to the collection notes. Available in a metallic Goji Berry Red and Black Caviar, the vinyl foil spandex sets feature heart-shaped locket and key charm zipper pulls and rose gold hardware for the “bad ass babe”.

Down the Aisle, in contrast, is “deceivingly sweet”, all delicate ruffles and heart trims. Designed to be layered, mixed and matched, the separates have a vintage look, as well as that girl next door aesthetic.

Each set is packaged neatly into a Savage X Fenty Xtra VIP box with a bonus collectors’ Rihanna phone ring. But it will be the campaign faces that sway you to click to buy, rather than the gift. Adesuwa Aighewi, Fiffany Luu, Joan Smalls and Paloma Elsesser are shot by Dennis Leupold in a wildly kitsch bedroom. “I’ve been really fortunate to have people from all different fields wear my brand,” Selman muses of the Adam Selman effect (his sportswear is also seen in gym selfies across Instagram). “I like that my brand is a community, and I think that’s what makes it feel like a ‘cult following’.” Add to that Rihanna’s loyalists across the globe – “She is just miles ahead of the industry, and her dedication and passion is beyond,” says Selman – and the duo is about to Fentify Valentine’s Day.

For true bad gals who are allergic to the Hallmark holiday, the “naughty-but-nice” knickers will be available to buy through spring via additional drops. “Rihanna is the best,” Selman affirms. “Period.”

The Locket Down box, $59.95 (£46), and Down the Aisle box, $39.95 (£30), are available to buy now at Savagex.com

"A Zimbabwean man allegedly killed his Zambian business partner by striking him with a log following a heated dispute over the sharing of profits after the two had sold fish.

The 20-yer-old, Evans Ngwenya allegedly struck Paul Banda twice with a log and struck his skull following a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.

Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic.

Ngwenya was ccharged with murder and has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

In his bail application, Ngwenya offered to pay $200 bail and to continue residing at his given address until the case has been finalized.

He also offered to surrender his canoe as surety.

The State opposed the bail application, arguing that there was no guarantee that the accused person wouldn’t flee if given bail

“The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would therefore be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding,” said Ms Ngwenya.

According to court papers, Ngwenya and Banda went on a fishing expedition at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga district where they had an altercation after arguing on the fish sale profits.

During their fight, Ngwenya picked a log and struck Banda twice on the head.

He sustained head injuries and he was taken to Siabuwa Clinic the following day where he succumbed to the injuries.

A report was made at the police leading to Ngwenya’s arrest.

According to the post mortem report the cause of death was skull fracture and assault.

"As our communities deal with the spread of the coronavirus, federal leaders must take bold steps to ensure the safety of the public, particularly the most vulnerable among us. While this virus will hit communities regardless of race, income, or zip code, this pandemic will cause both health and economic disruptions that exacerbate the existing disparities for low-income people and communities of color that have long harmed our nation.

CALL YOUR SENATOR



Please call your senators and ask them to pass the emergency House bill to help us navigate this public health and economic crisis.

Early Saturday morning, the House passed an emergency bill that would allocate billions of dollars for paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing, and other measures to help those impacted by this crisis. This is a necessary starting point that the Senate must pass now.

Unfortunately, these measures are narrow in scope, leaving 80 percent of workers unprotected. While some large employers are doing the right thing and giving employees sick leave, a national policy is the most effective measure in this time of unprecedented national crisis. We need comprehensive legislation to follow this initial bill to protect all people, especially those with the greatest health and economic risks.

We Need Comprehensive Public Health and Economic Supports



Today, 100 million people — one in three people in the US — live in or on the brink of poverty where an illness, job loss, or unexpected expense can be financially insurmountable. At a time when officials are urging the public to stay home when they fall ill, millions of people lack paid sick leave and can’t afford to miss work to care for themselves or a loved one. This puts many people at risk for being the vector of an illness that can prove deadly for the elderly and immunocompromised. And as businesses take precautions or are forced through social-distancing norms to close, the resulting loss of income for workers and owners will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and risk their housing, health, utility, and food security.

We must plan and act with the most vulnerable in mind to both stop the spread of this virus, and ensure that weeks and months of addressing this public health crisis don’t turn into years of economic hardship.

Specifically, we are calling on federal leaders to champion the following policies:

Pass a Paid Leave Policy for All Workers – Low-wage workers who cannot afford to lose a day's wages because of illness are less likely to seek medical care (for themselves and for their families) than workers who do have paid sick leave, and are 1.5 times more likely to go to work with contagious illnesses. This means that lack of paid sick leave is not only a problem for individual workers, but also a public health threat. Building on the House-passed version, a paid sick leave policy that covers all workers is urgently needed to address the new coronavirus outbreak and beyond to help protect the health and safety of the population.

Ensure Emergency Income During Work Disruptions – We need to provide guaranteed income to help those facing disruptions to their income due to lost opportunities, funding streams, or customers. This includes small business owners and their employees, community-serving nonprofits, freelancers and artists, and workers in a gig economy who are not eligible for unemployment benefits but still must make their rent or mortgage payments.

Place a Moratorium on All Evictions and Foreclosures and Ensure Housing Stability – We are in the midst of a housing crisis – We are in the midst of a housing crisis where 21 million renters and 17 million homeowners pay more than a third of their income on housing bills, making them extremely vulnerable to income disruptions. We need a moratorium on all evictions and foreclosures to prevent the economic fallout of the virus. We must also provide emergency housing vouchers for all unhoused people, and those facing eviction. And at a minimum, we need to stop displacing homeless encampments, and take measures to increase access to water, hand-washing stations, and sanitation at current encampments to support critical health outcomes.

Prevent Utility Shut-Offs and Restore Water Service to All Households – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. Over a third of US households are already at risk of inability to pay rising water bills. This is particularly concerning as washing our hands is our first line of defense against the virus. All public and private utilities should halt any utility shut-offs during this crisis, restore service to households currently experiencing a shutoff, and provide water delivery to all households with contaminated water systems.

Ensure Hospitals and Health-Care Centers Are Safe Places for Immigrants and Anyone Seeking Care – We must eliminate all barriers to people seeking proper medical attention, regardless of insurance or lack thereof. This also includes ensuring no one’s immigration status will be questioned when seeking assistance. Hospitals and health-care facilities must make it clear in all languages that immigration status will not be questioned, and should take steps to ensure immigration enforcement officials are not permitted in buildings.

Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 Through the Incarcerated Population – In the US, – In the US, 2.3 million people are exposed to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in prisons and jails, which will contribute to the spread of the coronavirus as the incarcerated population interacts with staff and other visitors. At a minimum, we must ensure incarcerated people have access to medical care and personal hygiene products; release elderly people with underlying medical problems to parole supervision; and release those who have an anticipated release date in 2020 and 2021 to parole supervision.

We are heartened by the swift actions that leaders in cities across the country are taking, proving once again that local leaders are national leaders. But we need policymakers at all levels to urgently address the threat of this current pandemic while ensuring we protect all struggling communities beyond this crisis.

The Chronicle reports that Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic. The publication also reports that the duo had a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.

Ngwenya who is now facing a murder charge in connection with Banda’s death has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

The State, however, opposed the bail application arguing that there was no guarantee that Ngwenya would not abscond once released on bail. Representing the State, Ms Nokuthaba Ngwenya said:

The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would, therefore, be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding.

She added that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and the investigations have been completed hence releasing him would not serve justice.

The amount of money which te duo was fighting for is not known.

The stock has risen every month since March 2018.

Transactions increased the stock of retail loans by HUF 83.1 bln but revaluations reduced it by HUF 5.7 bln. Forint-denominated transactions increased the stock by HUF 83.6 bln and FX transactions lowered it by HUF 500 million.

Stock of retail deposits rose HUF 91.9 bln to almost HUF 9.370 tln with net deposit placements adding HUF 70.4 bln and revaluations raising the stock by HUF 21.5 bln.

Net inflows increased forint deposits by HUF 84.6 bln and net withdrawals reduced foreign currency deposits by HUF 14.2 bln. Revaluations increased the FX deposits by HUF 21.5 bln and reduced forint deposits by just HUF 100 million.

The euro weakened 1.48% to the forint between the end of October and the end of November, calculating with the central bankʼs daily fixing.","the nasdaq composite index rose 13.70 , or 0.8 per cent , to 1700.34 .",0.7965056

Madison Community Rallies To Restore Beloved, Storm-Damaged BallparkIn the town of 1,500, baseball brings people together. It’s been that way for decades. The storm destroyed a good portion of the outfield fence, took down four, 80-foot light towers, and ripped the roofs off of both dugouts.",".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — New Year’s Eve revelers can expect a chilly end to 2019.

But no travel problems are expected — at least through much of New Year’s Day.

A storm system moving in from the northwest could make things a little slick New Year’s night into Thursday. National Weather Service meteorologists said accumulating snow is expected in the western and central parts of the state, especially in the northern mountains. An accumulation of an inch or less is predicted for the Albuquerque metro on Thursday, with a little more than an inch expected in Santa Fe. A few additional inches are possible in the northern mountains. Rain mixed with snow is expected to spread across the eastern plains on Thursday.

Cold temperatures are expected to remain throughout the week, with a possible warming trend coming during the weekend. Temperatures are expected to be between 5 to 10 degrees below normal Tuesday into Wednesday. The weather service is urging residents to protect pipes, pets and plants over the next couple days. Highs in the 40s and lows in the mid and low 20s are expected through the remainder of the week in the Albuquerque metro. Low temperatures are expected to be in the teens or single digits in northern New Mexico.

Roads are expected to be slick in the western part of the state and in the northern mountains Wednesday night into Thursday. Gusty winds could also make travel hazardous along the I-40 corridor in eastern New Mexico.

Cold, drier weather is expected Friday, with warmer temperatures Saturday and much of Sunday before another storm system moves across the state bringing more chances of snow late Sunday into Monday.

"A Gokwe man, Evans Ngwenya (20) allegedly fatally struck his Zambian business partner, Paul Banda, with a log and fractured his skull following a dispute over the sharing of profits after the two had sold fish.

The Chronicle reports that Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic. The publication also reports that the duo had a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.

Ngwenya who is now facing a murder charge in connection with Banda’s death has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

The State, however, opposed the bail application arguing that there was no guarantee that Ngwenya would not abscond once released on bail. Representing the State, Ms Nokuthaba Ngwenya said:

The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would, therefore, be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding.

She added that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and the investigations have been completed hence releasing him would not serve justice.

The amount of money which te duo was fighting for is not known.

More: The Chronicle","Acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother and his uncle are under investigation for assault.

Police confirmed that the king's spokesperson, Babalo Papu, was rescued from an alleged attack.

The latest drama comes in the midst of a war between Azenathi and his father, AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

Babalo Papu, an advisor to AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, has approached police to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family - including acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo.

Papu has accused Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother Buyiswa Majiki and Azenathi's spokesperson, uncle and advisor, Siganeko Dalindyebo, and others of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH).

Majiki is an Eastern Cape High Court judge and the former wife of Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

Called for comment, on Thursday Majiki said: ""Indeed it came to my knowledge that a criminal case has been opened against me but I have no knowledge of these allegations or circumstances surrounding the case.""

The matter was reported to the Madeira police station in Mthatha on Wednesday evening, according to police.

It came a day after the police were called to a Maiden Farm address and rescued Papu from an alleged assault by a group of men, police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said.

On Thursday, Soci said: ""[Police] can confirm that a case of assault GBH has been opened for investigation. The complainant will be interviewed further to ascertain other information that has surfaced regarding the investigation.""

Siganeko Dalindyebo confirmed he was involved in the alleged assault, saying he found Papu talking to his wife on his premises.

I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo

Both Papu and Siganeko find themselves on opposite ends of the father-and-son battle for kingship. Papu acts as an advisor to Buyelekhaya and Siganeko to Azenathi.

""I, Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo, feel I was provoked by Babalo and the people who he was conniving with and gave him my wife's cellphone number. I felt it was an attack on my integrity and manhood and to the safety of my family and those close to me, by finding my sole enemy inside my premises.""

""How naïve can he be as a person to go to a home of a person [when] he knows they don't get along, based on the Dalindyebo succession debate, communicating with my wife and entering my gate? He can't expect me to feel safe. I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. I felt I should protect myself and loved ones from my enemy,"" Siganeko said.

Siganeko said his wife spend most of the time alone in Mthatha. He is based 50km away at Bumbane Great Place where he serves as a traditional leader and as one of the advisors to acting king Azenathi.

Meanwhile, Soci said: ""SAPS can confirm a complaint was received yesterday at about 15:00 and police were dispatched to the scene at Maiden Farm. Upon arrival, they found a visibly assaulted man and intervened by removing the injured person from immediate danger and also ensured that his vehicle was removed from the premises.""

Soci earlier said Papu had been advised to open cases of assault, crimen injuria and malicious damage to property against the ""people who assaulted him and damaged his vehicle"".

Contacted for comment, Papu responded with a short statement he had posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday night: ""I am in good shape, I cannot go into details or merits of this matter as advised by my legal counsel.

""I can only confirm that I was brutally attacked by Sganeko, Azenathi, Azenathi's body guard, [whose name was withheld] and one more guy I still need to find his name (sic).

""This is all I can say, thank you very much nge calls, sms, What'sApp shows that I am not alone (sic).

""Thank you and goodnight to all. Babalo Batembu Papu.""

News24 tried several times to get comment from Azenathi for his side of the story. Attempts included several phone calls and text messages to him since Tuesday. His phone was off and his spokesperson, Siganeko, declined to speak on his behalf, saying the acting king should speak for himself.

Father-and-son war

The latest drama came a day after AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court for assault. He disowned Azenathi and his claim to the throne, demanding a paternity test.

The assault case was opened by Azenathi on 13 March after Dalindyebo allegedly trespassed on the Bumbane Great Place palace, outside Mthatha, and allegedly used an axe to attack Azenathi at around 03:00.

National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 7 December for further investigation.

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is currently staying at Nkululekweni residence in Mthatha, following his early release from prison in December. He only served four years of his 12-year sentence when President Cyril Ramaphosa granted him special remission parole as part of a larger category of offenders.

He had been sent to jail in 2015 for arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. He was found guilty of terrorising his subjects in the 1990s.

The father-and-son war dates to 2016 when Azenathi went against his incarcerated father's advice and ascended to the throne.

The king wanted his wife to act on his behalf and had written a series of prison letters advising the then University of Free State student, Azenathi, to focus on his studies.",0.8864008

Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic.

Ngwenya was ccharged with murder and has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

In his bail application, Ngwenya offered to pay $200 bail and to continue residing at his given address until the case has been finalized.

He also offered to surrender his canoe as surety.

The State opposed the bail application, arguing that there was no guarantee that the accused person wouldn’t flee if given bail

“The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would therefore be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding,” said Ms Ngwenya.

According to court papers, Ngwenya and Banda went on a fishing expedition at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga district where they had an altercation after arguing on the fish sale profits.

During their fight, Ngwenya picked a log and struck Banda twice on the head.

He sustained head injuries and he was taken to Siabuwa Clinic the following day where he succumbed to the injuries.

A report was made at the police leading to Ngwenya’s arrest.

According to the post mortem report the cause of death was skull fracture and assault.

"A Zimbabwean man allegedly killed his Zambian business partner by striking him with a log following a heated dispute over the sharing of profits after the two had sold fish.

The 20-yer-old, Evans Ngwenya allegedly struck Paul Banda twice with a log and struck his skull following a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.

Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic.

Ngwenya was ccharged with murder and has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

In his bail application, Ngwenya offered to pay $200 bail and to continue residing at his given address until the case has been finalized.

He also offered to surrender his canoe as surety.

The State opposed the bail application, arguing that there was no guarantee that the accused person wouldn’t flee if given bail

“The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would therefore be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding,” said Ms Ngwenya.

According to court papers, Ngwenya and Banda went on a fishing expedition at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga district where they had an altercation after arguing on the fish sale profits.

During their fight, Ngwenya picked a log and struck Banda twice on the head.

He sustained head injuries and he was taken to Siabuwa Clinic the following day where he succumbed to the injuries.

A report was made at the police leading to Ngwenya’s arrest.

According to the post mortem report the cause of death was skull fracture and assault.

(Visited 35 times, 1 visits today)","A Gokwe man, Evans Ngwenya (20) allegedly fatally struck his Zambian business partner, Paul Banda, with a log and fractured his skull following a dispute over the sharing of profits after the two had sold fish.

The Chronicle reports that Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic. The publication also reports that the duo had a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.

Ngwenya who is now facing a murder charge in connection with Banda’s death has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

The State, however, opposed the bail application arguing that there was no guarantee that Ngwenya would not abscond once released on bail. Representing the State, Ms Nokuthaba Ngwenya said:

The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would, therefore, be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding.

She added that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and the investigations have been completed hence releasing him would not serve justice.

The amount of money which te duo was fighting for is not known.
