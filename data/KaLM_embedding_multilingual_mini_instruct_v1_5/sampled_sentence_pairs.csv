A woman dances in the rain out side.,"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

Affected customers will be notified and rebooked on other flights, SIA said.

SIA currently operates 56 weekly flights to Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, while SilkAir operates 36 weekly flights to Chengdu, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Xiamen.

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

2 Claimed sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF are to be published online Credit: Workbook Stock - Getty

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

2 Drawing of an 'alien spacecraft' spotted by two US servicemen during an unexplained incident in the Suffolk countryside in 1980 Credit: Alamy

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",The young boy jumps barefoot outside in the front yard.,0.45606673

The little girl is riding a bicycle in a race,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

2 Claimed sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF are to be published online Credit: Workbook Stock - Getty

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

2 Drawing of an 'alien spacecraft' spotted by two US servicemen during an unexplained incident in the Suffolk countryside in 1980 Credit: Alamy

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

A girl is bungee jumping.,"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

2 Drawing of an 'alien spacecraft' spotted by two US servicemen during an unexplained incident in the Suffolk countryside in 1980 Credit: Alamy

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

The little girl is riding a bicycle in a race,"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

"Among the popular stars of the Gen-Z, Sara Ali Khan is the one who has filmmakers lining up to cast her in their films. Despite being just 3 films old, Sara enjoys a massive fan base and the star is considered to be one of the style icons of the youth. However, despite all of it, the gorgeous Love Aaj Kal star revealed that there was once a film narration that she wanted to escape at all costs and was even willing to fake a heart attack but her mom Amrita Singh talked sense into her.

Yes, in a candid conversation with East India Comedy, Sara revealed that once she was stuck in a very lengthy narration and the filmmaker was going on and on about the film. However, the Love Aaj Kal star shared that she wanted to escape the narration even by going to the extreme length of wanting to fake cardiac arrest. Sara described the episode and said, “There was this one time. I am not going to say much…because he said so much!”

(Also Read: Sara Ali Khan looks like a spitting image of mom Amrita Singh as she recreates the latter's pose; See PHOTO)

She went onto reveal that she called her mom, Amrita Singh from the washroom and told her that she is ready to fake cardiac arrest to get out the narration. However, the Love Aaj Kal star was told by the senior star to sit through the narration and to be professional till the end. Sara recalled the incident and said, “I went to the restroom with my phone, three hours in, and I told my mom, ‘Look, I know that we are all professional and we should be thankful for these opportunities… But can I pretend to have a cardiac arrest? Is that allowed?’ She said no, so I asked, ‘Should I faint? Should I throw up? What do I do?’ She told me that I have to go back with professionalism and continue till the end.”

Sara Ali Khan's latest photo:

Later, Sara revealed that she continued to hear the filmmaker for five hours and then when she went home, she told her mom Amrita that she hates her now and she doesn’t want to talk and just needs sleep. Well, surely the starlet tried her best to escape the situation but was talked out of it by her mom. On the work front, Sara’s recent release is Kartik Aaryan starrer Love Aaj Kal by Imtiaz Ali. Next, Sara will be seen in David Dhawan’s Coolie No 1 with Varun Dhawan. It will hit the screens on May 1, 2020.

It will release on Valentine’s Day 2021.",The young boy jumps barefoot outside in the front yard.,0.46720424

"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

A young boy in the blue shirt is jumping into the water,"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

Two girls are sitting on an ATV on the sand in front of a bridge.,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

"In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: “We’ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.”

But Hopsquad hasn’t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.

Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad — just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.

>> RELATED: Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin

Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.

A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck’s website.

Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year’s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.

"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",A woman is slicing a pumpkin.,0.4720552

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

A large white dog is jumping in the air over a snowy area,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

The dog is on a leash and is walking in the water,"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

Two girls are sitting on an ATV on the sand in front of a bridge.,"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",0.48048204

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

a little girl running at on the shore of a beach .,"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

a woman is swimming .,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

two cats are fighting each other .,"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",0.49203405

"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",The man is sitting on the floor in a room and strumming a guitar,0.49378592

"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",A kid is smiling at the camera and swimming underwater,0.4949507
"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",a woman is playing violin .,0.49546733

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

2 Claimed sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF are to be published online Credit: Workbook Stock - Getty

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object.

two little girls are playing on a trampoline .,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

"In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: “We’ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.”

But Hopsquad hasn’t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.

Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad — just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.

>> RELATED: Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin

Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.

A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck’s website.

Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year’s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",0.5081531

a man is putting a pan into an oven .,"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",0.50993717

"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",Two women are wearing bikinis and are walking on the sand,0.51162165
Two women are wearing bikinis and are walking on the sand,"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",0.512214
Two girls are sitting on an ATV on the sand in front of a bridge.,"The New Right Party is on the lookout for some new candidates to add to its electoral list for the upcoming elections who will boost its popularity, including some former members of the Zehut Party. New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",0.5127957
a dog is barking at a ball .,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

Three hikers are sitting on a mountainside and looking at the view with a pair of binoculars,"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

A young boy in the blue shirt is jumping into the water,"In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: “We’ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.”

But Hopsquad hasn’t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.

Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad — just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.

>> RELATED: Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin

Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.

A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck’s website.

Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year’s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

"Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb (R) signed an executive order Friday pushing the state’s May 5 presidential primary to June 2, joining a growing group of governors who’ve postponed elections amid the coronavirus outbreak.

He said in the order that Secretary of State Connie Lawson had made known to him the “extreme difficulty” the state would face in holding the primary as scheduled while also complying with coronavirus guidance.

He, like many of his fellow governors, had already shuttered bars and restaurants in the state.

Indiana will now join the swelling rank of states that have pushed back their presidential primaries, including Maryland, Ohio, Kentucky, Connecticut, Louisiana and Georgia.

There are dogs in the forest.,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

A man is playing the guitar loudly,"The New Right Party is on the lookout for some new candidates to add to its electoral list for the upcoming elections who will boost its popularity, including some former members of the Zehut Party. New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",0.52604413

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

"The New Right Party is on the lookout for some new candidates to add to its electoral list for the upcoming elections who will boost its popularity, including some former members of the Zehut Party. New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",A girl is skateboarding on a half pipe,0.5277674

a large tan dog is running with a green item in its mouth,"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",0.52950287
"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

"In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: “We’ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.”

But Hopsquad hasn’t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.

Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad — just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.

>> RELATED: Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin

Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.

A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck’s website.

Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year’s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.

A brown dog is running after a white dog on a rocky shore,"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

There is no little black dog chasing a little brown dog,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

[Travel Advisory] SINGAPORE AIRLINES AND SILKAIR FLIGHTS TO MAINLAND CHINA Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will further... Posted by Singapore Airlines on Thursday, 30 January 2020

Affected customers will be notified and rebooked on other flights, SIA said.

SIA currently operates 56 weekly flights to Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, while SilkAir operates 36 weekly flights to Chengdu, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Xiamen.

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

2 Claimed sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF are to be published online Credit: Workbook Stock - Getty

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

2 Drawing of an 'alien spacecraft' spotted by two US servicemen during an unexplained incident in the Suffolk countryside in 1980 Credit: Alamy

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

She went onto reveal that she called her mom, Amrita Singh from the washroom and told her that she is ready to fake cardiac arrest to get out the narration. However, the Love Aaj Kal star was told by the senior star to sit through the narration and to be professional till the end. Sara recalled the incident and said, “I went to the restroom with my phone, three hours in, and I told my mom, ‘Look, I know that we are all professional and we should be thankful for these opportunities… But can I pretend to have a cardiac arrest? Is that allowed?’ She said no, so I asked, ‘Should I faint? Should I throw up? What do I do?’ She told me that I have to go back with professionalism and continue till the end.”

Later, Sara revealed that she continued to hear the filmmaker for five hours and then when she went home, she told her mom Amrita that she hates her now and she doesn’t want to talk and just needs sleep. Well, surely the starlet tried her best to escape the situation but was talked out of it by her mom. On the work front, Sara’s recent release is Kartik Aaryan starrer Love Aaj Kal by Imtiaz Ali. Next, Sara will be seen in David Dhawan’s Coolie No 1 with Varun Dhawan. It will hit the screens on May 1, 2020.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

"In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: “We’ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.”

But Hopsquad hasn’t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.

Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad — just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.

Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.

A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck’s website.

Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year’s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.

"A handwritten note at the memorial for Damien Helmbrecht reads: “My son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.” Olivia Sullivan/staff photo

Outside of the Westway Community Center in Federal Way, a memorial honors the life of a 19-year-old man who was shot and killed Monday night.

Just after 10:40 p.m. April 20, Federal Way police responded to reports of a shooting at the community center in the 33400 block of 21st Avenue SW. A male victim was found near the building, and although life-saving measures were attempted by first responders, he died at the scene.

The victim has been identified as 19-year-old Damien Helmbrecht. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso and the death has been ruled a homicide, according to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Candles, bouquets of flowers, balloons, empty liquor bottles and handwritten notes are now placed at the corner of the community center’s driveway.

Tucked in a bundle of pink roses, a handwritten note reads: “My son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.”

A motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Federal Way police have not located any suspects. Investigation of the incident is still underway.

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

2 Claimed sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF are to be published online Credit: Workbook Stock - Getty

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

2 Drawing of an 'alien spacecraft' spotted by two US servicemen during an unexplained incident in the Suffolk countryside in 1980 Credit: Alamy

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

A blond child is holding a yellow bottle,"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",0.5554384

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

"CLAIMED sightings of UFOs reported to the RAF by terrified members of the British public are to be published online for the first time.

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

"In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: “We’ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.”

But Hopsquad hasn’t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.

Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad — just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.

>> RELATED: Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin

Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.

A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck’s website.

Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year’s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

"The New Right Party is on the lookout for some new candidates to add to its electoral list for the upcoming elections who will boost its popularity, including some former members of the Zehut Party. New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",how do i pump up water pressure in my shower ?,0.5738869

New Right will possibly add one or two new candidates to its recent electoral lists, and may make some appointments based on the ability of such candidates to boost the party’s electoral appeal in specific sectors of the population.To that end, party coleader and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met in recent days with figures in the newly established New Liberal Party, including Libby Molad and Refael Minnes, who were both candidates in the Zehut Party’s run for Knesset in the April elections.Zehut took 2.74% of the vote in that election, not enough to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold but enough to garner 118,000 votes, worth some three Knesset seats.Many of those ballot slips were likely cast by politically right-wing, economically liberal voters who could see New Right as a reasonable alternative to Zehut in the upcoming election, given the party’s right-wing approach to diplomatic and security affairs and its economic, free market liberalism.Sources in New Right confirmed that there have been contacts between Bennett and the former Zehut figures, but said that any agreement would see the addition of only one individual in an obtainable spot on the party list, and that any notion that New Right would merge with another party is not realistic.The source added that no decision on new candidates for its electoral list is imminent, and that New Right is looking at potential new candidates from a spectrum of population sectors and smaller parties.Such candidates could come from the Anglophone, French or Ethiopian communities, or from the community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the order of candidates on the New Right electoral list could be altered from its previous iterations, with the possibility that some candidates will be moved up or down.Molad said in response to the initial report about the contacts with New Right that the New Liberal Party is looking at “different connections with parties whose values overlap with the liberal values we bring with us,” adding that New Right is “certainly a worthwhile option,” but that “when we reach this river we will cross it.”",0.582536

"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

uganda 's president signs anti-gay bill,"Among the popular stars of the Gen-Z, Sara Ali Khan is the one who has filmmakers lining up to cast her in their films. Despite being just 3 films old, Sara enjoys a massive fan base and the star is considered to be one of the style icons of the youth. However, despite all of it, the gorgeous Love Aaj Kal star revealed that there was once a film narration that she wanted to escape at all costs and was even willing to fake a heart attack but her mom Amrita Singh talked sense into her.

Yes, in a candid conversation with East India Comedy, Sara revealed that once she was stuck in a very lengthy narration and the filmmaker was going on and on about the film. However, the Love Aaj Kal star shared that she wanted to escape the narration even by going to the extreme length of wanting to fake cardiac arrest. Sara described the episode and said, “There was this one time. I am not going to say much…because he said so much!”

(Also Read: Sara Ali Khan looks like a spitting image of mom Amrita Singh as she recreates the latter's pose; See PHOTO)

She went onto reveal that she called her mom, Amrita Singh from the washroom and told her that she is ready to fake cardiac arrest to get out the narration. However, the Love Aaj Kal star was told by the senior star to sit through the narration and to be professional till the end. Sara recalled the incident and said, “I went to the restroom with my phone, three hours in, and I told my mom, ‘Look, I know that we are all professional and we should be thankful for these opportunities… But can I pretend to have a cardiac arrest? Is that allowed?’ She said no, so I asked, ‘Should I faint? Should I throw up? What do I do?’ She told me that I have to go back with professionalism and continue till the end.”

Later, Sara revealed that she continued to hear the filmmaker for five hours and then when she went home, she told her mom Amrita that she hates her now and she doesn’t want to talk and just needs sleep. Well, surely the starlet tried her best to escape the situation but was talked out of it by her mom. On the work front, Sara’s recent release is Kartik Aaryan starrer Love Aaj Kal by Imtiaz Ali.

"Local budget carrier Scoot will suspend all flights between Singapore and mainland China from Feb 8, amid the growing severity of the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

[Travel Advisory] SINGAPORE AIRLINES AND SILKAIR FLIGHTS TO MAINLAND CHINA Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will further... Posted by Singapore Airlines on Thursday, 30 January 2020

Affected customers will be notified and rebooked on other flights, SIA said.

SIA currently operates 56 weekly flights to Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, while SilkAir operates 36 weekly flights to Chengdu, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Xiamen.

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.

Outside of the Westway Community Center in Federal Way, a memorial honors the life of a 19-year-old man who was shot and killed Monday night.

Just after 10:40 p.m. April 20, Federal Way police responded to reports of a shooting at the community center in the 33400 block of 21st Avenue SW. A male victim was found near the building, and although life-saving measures were attempted by first responders, he died at the scene.

The victim has been identified as 19-year-old Damien Helmbrecht. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso and the death has been ruled a homicide, according to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Candles, bouquets of flowers, balloons, empty liquor bottles and handwritten notes are now placed at the corner of the community center’s driveway.

Tucked in a bundle of pink roses, a handwritten note reads: “My son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.”

A motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Federal Way police have not located any suspects. Investigation of the incident is still underway.

unfortunately the answer to your question is we simply do not know .,"The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",0.613086

"A handwritten note at the memorial for Damien Helmbrecht reads: “My son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.” Olivia Sullivan/staff photo

Outside of the Westway Community Center in Federal Way, a memorial honors the life of a 19-year-old man who was shot and killed Monday night.

Just after 10:40 p.m. April 20, Federal Way police responded to reports of a shooting at the community center in the 33400 block of 21st Avenue SW. A male victim was found near the building, and although life-saving measures were attempted by first responders, he died at the scene.

The victim has been identified as 19-year-old Damien Helmbrecht. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso and the death has been ruled a homicide, according to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Candles, bouquets of flowers, balloons, empty liquor bottles and handwritten notes are now placed at the corner of the community center’s driveway.

Tucked in a bundle of pink roses, a handwritten note reads: “My son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.”

A motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Federal Way police have not located any suspects. Investigation of the incident is still underway.

"By Jonah DeChants

Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made news earlier this year for his statements about transgender people.

In a September meeting with HUD staff, Carson remarked that he was concerned about ""big, hairy men"" trying to use women's shelters. It is reported that his comments upset the HUD staff in attendance, causing one women to leave the room in protest.

Carson later doubled down on his comments in a congressional hearing, declining to apologize and saying ""I think this whole concept of political correctness – you can say this, you can't say that, you can't repeat what someone said – is total foolishness.""

While his comments demonstrate a lack of understanding of the needs of transgender people, his agency's moves to remove protections represent a real threat for transgender Americans who need shelter.

As my research shows, transgender people experience high rates of discrimination in housing and shelter services, exacerbating their already elevated rates of homelessness.

Disproportionate Risk of Homelessness

According to the 2017 U.S. Trans Survey, a survey of more than 27,000 transgender people across the U.S. conducted by the nonprofit National Center for Transgender Equality, 30% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Twelve percent report at least one episode of homelessness in the last year.

Once they become homeless, transgender people are also likely to experience discrimination and harassment when seeking shelter services. A study by the Center for American Progress found that 21% of shelters refuse to serve transgender women.

While in a shelter, 70% of U.S. Trans Survey respondents reported harassment, sexual or physical assault due to their transgender identity.

This discrimination makes transgender people hesitant to seek shelter – more than a quarter of respondents reported avoiding staying in shelter due to fear or mistreatment.

Best Practices

There is a small but growing body of literature on the experiences and needs of transgender people living in homeless shelters.

Organizations that work on LGBTQ housing access, such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and True Colors United, recommend that shelters respect clients’ self-identified gender as best practice for housing transgender clients.

In practice, this can include housing clients in the dorm of their self-identified gender; offering private living and bathing spaces; training shelter staff about transgender identities; and adopting inclusive language in administrative paperwork, such as intake forms.

Recognizing both the high levels of need and the unique challenges faced by transgender people experiencing homelessness, the National Coalition for the Homeless adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003, which protects people on the basis of gender identity and expression.

In 2016, HUD implemented new regulations to protect transgender people from discrimination in housing services. The Gender Identity Rule clarified policies for single-gender shelter facilities with shared sleeping or living spaces.

It required all HUD funding recipients to respect the gender identity of transgender clients, housing them in facilities that align with their gender identity rather than their birth sex. It also removed a previous prohibition against asking about clients' gender identity, allowing providers to ask about gender identity and house clients accordingly.

The rule included extensive guidance of how to safely house transgender clients, including information about bathroom facilities and how to deal with concerns or harassment from other clients.

Weakened Regulations

While the Gender Identity Rule provided important protections, I also see significant weaknesses.

The nondiscrimination protections apply only to organizations which receive federal funding. Some shelters are run and funded by private, and often religious, organizations, and therefore do not have to follow this rule.

Enforcement mechanisms are also weak. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may submit a complaint to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. However, people experiencing homelessness may not be aware of their rights or have the capacity to submit a complaint while struggling to meet their basic needs.

What's more, the protections that this rule offers may soon be undone.

In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would give housing providers who get federal funding the right to establish their own policies regarding how to house transgender clients. The proposed rule states that organizations may use a client's sex to make decisions about where and how to house them, without providing any guidance about how to determine an individual's sex.

The proposed rule is now working its way through the regulatory process, with advocacy groups meeting with HUD to discuss its potential impact. It is also supposed to go through a period of public comment.

HUD has also scaled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which protects against discrimination in housing based on race, religion, sex, ability, and other protected classes, by freezing investigations into discriminatory practices. This freeze includes investigations into discrimination against parolees and former inmates, people with disabilities and racial or ethnic minorities.

The administration's decision to halt these investigations implies that they do not consider nondiscrimination protections to be a priority. That can further endanger transgender people experiencing discrimination in shelters and housing services.
