Akufo-Addo, Prez Ghana

President Nana Akufo-Addo has said Ghana, “for the first time in over 40 years”, has maintained “a fiscal deficit below five per cent of GDP for three years in a row”.

Delivering his State of the Nation Address to a one-sided Parliament on Thursday, 20 February 2020, Mr Akufo-Addo also said “in three years, we have reduced inflation to its lowest level (7.8% in January 2020) since 1992”.

“For the first time in over 20 years, the balance of trade (that is the difference between our exports and imports) has been in surplus for three (3) consecutive years.

“Our current account deficit is shrinking, interest rates are declining, and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first term government in the Fourth Republic.

“Our economic growth has rebounded to place Ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of 7%, up from 3.4% in 2016, the lowest in nearly three decades”, the President said.

According to him, the international community has taken note of his government’s performance, “resulting in Ghana, today, being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Africa”.

“The sovereign credit ratings agencies have upgraded our ratings, and also improved the outlook for this year, notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year.

“This is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy, as best illustrated by Ghana’s successful issue of the longest-dated Eurobond ever issued by a sub-Saharan African country, with investors placing fifteen billion United States dollars ($15 billion) of orders for Ghana’s forty-one (41) year Eurobond.

“The seven (7) year Bond attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for Ghana at six point three-seven-five percent (6.375%), compared with the nine point two-five percent (9.25%) Ghana had to pay for a similar Eurobond issue in 2016. No wonder Bloomberg, the reputable global financial media house, earlier this week, highlighted Ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in Africa.

“This expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy, and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs”, he said.",The woman is skating in the park.,0.30412206

Akufo-Addo, Prez Ghana

President Nana Akufo-Addo has said Ghana, “for the first time in over 40 years”, has maintained “a fiscal deficit below five per cent of GDP for three years in a row”.

Delivering his State of the Nation Address to a one-sided Parliament on Thursday, 20 February 2020, Mr Akufo-Addo also said “in three years, we have reduced inflation to its lowest level (7.8% in January 2020) since 1992”.

“For the first time in over 20 years, the balance of trade (that is the difference between our exports and imports) has been in surplus for three (3) consecutive years.

“Our current account deficit is shrinking, interest rates are declining, and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first term government in the Fourth Republic.

“Our economic growth has rebounded to place Ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of 7%, up from 3.4% in 2016, the lowest in nearly three decades”, the President said.

According to him, the international community has taken note of his government’s performance, “resulting in Ghana, today, being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Africa”.

“The sovereign credit ratings agencies have upgraded our ratings, and also improved the outlook for this year, notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year.

“This is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy, as best illustrated by Ghana’s successful issue of the longest-dated Eurobond ever issued by a sub-Saharan African country, with investors placing fifteen billion United States dollars ($15 billion) of orders for Ghana’s forty-one (41) year Eurobond.

“The seven (7) year Bond attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for Ghana at six point three-seven-five percent (6.375%), compared with the nine point two-five percent (9.25%) Ghana had to pay for a similar Eurobond issue in 2016. No wonder Bloomberg, the reputable global financial media house, earlier this week, highlighted Ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in Africa.

“This expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy, and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs”, he said.",0.35104948

Akufo-Addo, Prez Ghana

President Nana Akufo-Addo has said Ghana, “for the first time in over 40 years”, has maintained “a fiscal deficit below five per cent of GDP for three years in a row”.

Delivering his State of the Nation Address to a one-sided Parliament on Thursday, 20 February 2020, Mr Akufo-Addo also said “in three years, we have reduced inflation to its lowest level (7.8% in January 2020) since 1992”.

“For the first time in over 20 years, the balance of trade (that is the difference between our exports and imports) has been in surplus for three (3) consecutive years.

“Our current account deficit is shrinking, interest rates are declining, and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first term government in the Fourth Republic.

“Our economic growth has rebounded to place Ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of 7%, up from 3.4% in 2016, the lowest in nearly three decades”, the President said.

According to him, the international community has taken note of his government’s performance, “resulting in Ghana, today, being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Africa”.

“The sovereign credit ratings agencies have upgraded our ratings, and also improved the outlook for this year, notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year.

“This is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy, as best illustrated by Ghana’s successful issue of the longest-dated Eurobond ever issued by a sub-Saharan African country, with investors placing fifteen billion United States dollars ($15 billion) of orders for Ghana’s forty-one (41) year Eurobond.

“The seven (7) year Bond attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for Ghana at six point three-seven-five percent (6.375%), compared with the nine point two-five percent (9.25%) Ghana had to pay for a similar Eurobond issue in 2016. No wonder Bloomberg, the reputable global financial media house, earlier this week, highlighted Ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in Africa.

“This expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy, and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs”, he said.",0.3900115

"Forgive the obvious pun, but our vision for 2020 starts here.

As a news organization, it’s AIN’s job to stick to reporting on what has already happened. One exception is this time, every year. In the following segments, you’ll read what we believe to be the outlook for key elements of our industry for the next 12 months—views inevitably shaped by the past, but with an eye toward what we believe is just beyond the immediate horizon.

You’ll get our take on the immediate future of eVTOL, not the lofty aspirations of the over-optimistic, but the cold reality; the bubbling cauldron of election-year politics as it impacts our industry; 2020’s outlook for what’s in line for the FBO industry; what’s on tap for OEMs in an ever-volatile market; avionics in the wake of the ADS-B (soft?) deadline; and what you can expect to see on the shop floors—and in the order books—of MROs.

So, how did we do last year? Here are some samples of what we were projecting for 2019:

eVTOL: “Even if eVTOLs win public acceptance and clear regulatory and technological hurdles, can OEMs and service providers deliver the technology at a price the general public can afford?” That remains the biggest open question in aviation.



Touchscreens: “It won’t be a surprise to see more manufacturers adopting this technology, especially as younger tech-savvy pilots move up the flying food chain to more sophisticated aircraft.” Twelve months later, that seems on track.

Supersonics: “Through 2019, Aerion and its partners will be initiating the process of selecting Tier 1 suppliers for the next phase of development.” This predated the February 2019 announcement of Boeing’s investment and involvement in the AS2 project. Since then, the program has gone largely silent.

"With the finale of Bigg Boss 13 less than four days away, the tension inside the house is quite high at the moment. Salman Khan announced on Sunday that one contestant would be eliminated from the show soon.

The contestants were asked to rank the top five housemates, and they picked Paras Chhabra followed by Sidharth Shukla, Asim Riaz, Rashami Desai and Arti Singh.

In the previous task, Sidharth chose to save Paras. When confronted by Salman, he confessed that he picked Paras because he couldn’t decide between Shehnaaz and Arti. Soon after Salman’s exit, Shehnaaz and Sidharth had an argument. The two also had an argument with Arti regarding the same issue.

"New Delhi: Senior IAS officer Rajiv Bansal was Thursday named the CMD of national carrier Air India. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet approved Bansal;s appointment as CMD of Air India in the rank and pay of an Additional Secretary.

At present, Bansal, a 1988 batch officer of the Nagaland cadre, held the post of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. He succeeds Ashwani Lohani. In August 2017, he was given the additional charge as Air India’s CMD.

Bansal has had an earlier stint with the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) between 2006 and 2008.

Now Bansal will have his task cut out as the government is going for 100% disinvestment of the national career. Very soon the government will put up Air India for sale. The move is being opposed by 14 unions of Air India. So Bansal will have to handle everything carefully.

weak earnings drag us stocks lower in early trade,"Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb (R) signed an executive order Friday pushing the state’s May 5 presidential primary to June 2, joining a growing group of governors who’ve postponed elections amid the coronavirus outbreak.

He said in the order that Secretary of State Connie Lawson had made known to him the “extreme difficulty” the state would face in holding the primary as scheduled while also complying with coronavirus guidance.

He, like many of his fellow governors, had already shuttered bars and restaurants in the state.

Indiana will now join the swelling rank of states that have pushed back their presidential primaries, including Maryland, Ohio, Kentucky, Connecticut, Louisiana and Georgia.

"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""



The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Barve is retiring from service on February 29.
