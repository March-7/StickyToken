"Police have arrested a 38-year-old black man from Orange Country, NY, for stabbing five Jews in the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey on the seventh night of Hanukkah. If you’re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you’re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?

The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.

The names given to the bogeymen of today’s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it’s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn’t enough, the left has also decided that Jews — a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population — are “hyper-white” and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.

It’s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it’s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.

On the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it’s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn’t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.

Trump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.

On the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn’t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.

The left’s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.

What’s more, unlike Trump, some of the left’s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn’t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.

But the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women’s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP’s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.

Historically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today’s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – The City of Fort Lauderdale provided a New Year's Day update on the sewage main issues plaguing residents over the past month.

Two crews were seen by Local 10 News crews on Wednesday, working on the latest spills.

According to officials, those crews were doing cleanup and remediation work on the latest damaged pipes, which have been patched up.

A total of six sewage main breaks have happened in Fort Lauderdale since the beginning of December.

Restoration and remediation work is expected to continue this month.

The gushing raw human waste flooded streets and properties, closing roads and contaminating waterways, like the Tarpon River and Himmarshee Canal.

Residents now left wondering about the about the long term effects on their health and the health of the area’s waterways.

Hector Park and Virginia Young Park have been closed due to the spills.

The City of Fort Lauderdale set up several websites so that residents can have access to the most updated information.

"MUMBAI: The much-awaited redevelopment of the Bombay Development Directorate (BDD) chawls at NM Joshi Marg will begin only after the draw of lots for rehab buildings, said an official with the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), on condition of anonymity. The state housing authority plans to conduct the draw of lots in a month’s time. However, the authority will finalise the date only once the ministry portfolios are distributed.

The official asserted that as cabinet expansion has taken place on December 30, the portfolios accumulated with the six cabinet ministers, who took oath along with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the first round, will now be distributed. Currently, NCP’s Jayant Patil is in charge of the housing ministry. Though a meeting was conducted with Minister Patil, only after portfolios are confirmed a detailed presentation about the BDD chawls’ redevelopment project will be made and the date for the draw of lots decided, explained the official.

Interestingly, the NM Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Phase-1 project construction work was expected to begin last year after Diwali. However, unable to vacate the first 10 chawls the project missed the deadline, and the plan failed to take off.

This paper had reported that in a bid to expedite the shifting of tenants, the MHADA has come up with an offer asking tenants to shift to transit houses wherein on first come first basis they will get an opportunity to participate in the lottery draw. By conducting this lottery draw, the participant tenants will know which floors of the new buildings their houses will be located. The lottery for rehab houses will be held from the top floors of the 22-storeyed building.

Besides, MHADA will also sign an agreement with the lottery winners, giving a surety that they will get their houses back, unlike the city’s other stuck redevelopment projects undertaken mostly by the private developers.

MHADA is drawing the lottery of top floor houses after tenants even after repeated appeals were not willing to leave their houses and shift to the provided alternative places. Following which, this offer was made in a bid to lure residents of getting houses on the top floors of the buildings once ready. So far, 252 families have shifted to the transit houses, informed the official.

At NM Joshi, the authority as per the approved plans will construct seven towers comprising 22 floors each in phase-1, which will house 1,200 tenements. To construct the seven new towers, 10 existing chawls are required to be demolished first.

The tenants of NM Joshi Marg, including Dadar-Naigaon BDD Chawl tenants, are provided alternative accommodation in mill buildings. Ruby Mill, Jubilee Mill, Prakash Cotton Mill, Western India Mill, Century Mill, and Bharat Mill are the six mills that have been identified and have a total of 1,127 transit houses, according to the MHADA.

The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had performed the ground-breaking ceremony in April 2017. However, till date, not a single brick has been laid. MHADA, on the other end, is still convincing residents to support the redevelopment of century-old BDD chawls, which have been planned costing of Rs 17,000 crore approximately. If successfully completed, about 16,000 families living in BDD chawls at NM Joshi, Naigaon and Worli will get new 500 square feet of flats free of cost.",The baby is laughing and toddling,0.55015045

"Researchers have found that combining neurologic and blood pressure drugs may reduce breast tumour development.

According to the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, adding a medication used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraines to a blood pressure medicine reversed some aspects of breast cancer in the offspring of mice at high risk of the disease because of the high fat diet fed to their mothers during pregnancy.

""We believe that our research is the first to show that we can reverse some aspects of increased breast cancer risk found in offspring of mouse mothers fed a high fat diet during pregnancy,"" said study researcher Leena A Hilakivi-Clarke from the Georgetown University in the US.

""This finding may have important implications in people because exposures in the womb to certain chemicals, or a mother's high fat diet, or being obese, can subsequently increase a daughter's breast cancer risk,"" Hilakivi-Clarke.

According to the researchers, the key drug in the study regimen was valproic acid which, among several targets, inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), an important epigenetic silencer of genes.

In contrast to mutations that permanently disrupt the normal functions of genes, epigenetic modifications are reversible.

Valproic acid was combined with the blood pressure medication hydralazine that inhibits another critical epigenetic regulator, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).

Early treatment studies in people have shown that these two drugs can work in tandem to disrupt tumour growth.

These research findings demonstrate how impactful an epigenetic methyl group addition or subtraction from DNA can be.

Compounds that reduce methylation of tumour suppressor genes that are excessively methylated (hypermethylated) can be beneficial.

However, these drugs can have the opposite effect if tumour suppressor genes are not hypermethylated; they may remove methyl groups from cancer-causing genes, making these genes more active and potentially leading to more aggressive cancers.

The other key aspect of this finding involves the potential impact of diet on cancer risk. Many fruits and vegetables have compounds (such as flavones) that chemically react in the same ways as the HDAC- and DNMT-inhibiting drugs in this study.

Some compounds in these foods, especially folic acid, have opposite effects.

This research suggests that exposure to a high fat diet or endocrine disrupting chemicals in the womb might be reversed by the consumption of foods high in DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, while those who have not had such exposures might also gain a cancer protective benefit from consuming foods high in folic acid.

The scientists noted, however, that their findings, particularly as they relate to diet, need to be studied in people.

""Our next step will be to try to identify biomarkers in humans that indicate an exposure in the womb to diets or endocrine disrupting chemicals that could increase breast cancer risk later in life,"" said Hilakivi-Clarke.

"Britain said on Monday that China had questions to answer over the information it shared about the novel coronavirus outbreak, but refused to comment on reports that a U.S.-led intelligence consortium had accused Beijing of a cover-up.

The U.S. has scaled up its rhetoric over Chinese culpability for the coronavirus in recent days, with U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, saying on Sunday there was evidence the disease emerged from a Chinese lab.

Washington has so far presented no evidence publicly that the virus came from a lab, which Beijing strongly denies.

The Australian Telegraph reported the U.S.-led Five Eyes intelligence consortium had in a 15-page research dossier said China had deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus outbreak in an “assault on international transparency” that cost tens of thousands of lives.

The Five Eyes group compises U.S., British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand intelligence services.

British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Every day I get intelligence bulletins from our agencies around the world.

“I don’t comment on individual bulletins, what I have and haven’t seen. That would be wrong.”

Asked if China had questions to answer over how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the crisis, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “I think it does.”

“China needs to be open and transparent about what it leant, its short comings but also its successes,” Wallace said, adding that the time for a post mortem was after the outbreak.

Reuters has not seen the Five Eyes dossier and was unable to immediately verify the Australian Telegraph report.

One Western intelligence source said it was now widely accepted that China had not been fully transparent.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was confident the coronavirus originated in a Chinese virology lab.

“Virus samples ordered destroyed at genomics labs, wildlife market stalls bleached, the genome sequence not shared publicly, the Shanghai lab closure for ‘rectification’,” the Telegraph quoted the document as saying.

“As we repeatedly point out, China has been fighting COVID-19 in an open, transparent and responsible manner,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular daily briefing on April 24.","the marcel ' s differs from the other by his cotton excellent , by his thumb unisexe , with its distinctive logo and by the belgian flag ( barely recognisable ) that the shirts of bodies have the most well-known in the neck .",0.5646628

After skating by largely unchallenged in last week’s debate in Las Vegas, Sanders drew repeated attacks over his past votes against gun control, the feasibility and cost of his proposals, what his nomination might mean for down-ballot Democrats running for office in November, reports that Russia might favor his campaign, his comments about Fidel Castro’s Cuba, and his opposition to eliminating the filibuster.

But with Super Tuesday and its many key primaries only a week away, Sanders’ rivals may have waited too long to challenge him onstage and in television ads across the country. And as much as they tried to focus on Sanders, they couldn’t resist getting distracted by squabbling among themselves.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, decided to run over former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg one more time, calling him out for supporting Republicans for Senate, including in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and her own state of Massachusetts. And she again excoriated the billionaire self-funder over his alleged treatment of his former female employees.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, went after billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who is threatening Biden’s support from Black voters in South Carolina. Biden whacked Steyer over his hedge fund’s millions of dollars of investments in the nation’s leading private prison corporation.

But it was Sanders who drew most of the attacks on Tuesday, as he noted onstage.

“I’m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why,” the senator quipped at one point.

In a shift, Warren launched her most direct attacks on Sanders yet. The two progressive champions have largely avoided going after each other in the 2020 race, but her path forward after South Carolina’s primary on Saturday is far less secure than that of Sanders.

The Massachusetts senator called out Sanders early on in the debate, saying she would “make a better president than Bernie” because of how she handled questions about “Medicare for All” and its implementation.

“It’s going to take someone to dig into the details to make it happen,” Warren said of her ‘Medicare for All’ plan, voicing frustration at the reaction from Sanders’ campaign. “I dug in, did the work, and Bernie’s team trashed me for it.”

Bloomberg whacked Sanders over reports that Russia is trying to help his campaign. “That’s why Russia is helping you get elected, so you’ll lose to [Donald Trump],” he said. But the senator gave as good as he got, criticizing Bloomberg over his past praise of China’s President Xi Jinping.

“I’m not a good friend of President Xi of China,” Sanders said. “I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader, and let me tell Mr. Putin, who tried to interfere in the 2016 election and tried to pit Americans against each other: Hey, Mr. Putin, if I’m president, trust me, you won’t interfere with any more elections.”

Biden slammed Sanders for past votes against gun control measures in the 1990s, including the Brady Act, which mandated federal background checks and a waiting period for some handgun purchases. Though Sanders now supports gun control measures, Biden said the 2015 church massacre in Charleston, which took place mere feet away from the debate stage, may have not have happened if stricter gun control measures were in place.

“I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths,” Biden said of Sanders, “but that man would not be able to get that weapon without a waiting period,” he added, referring to the shooter.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the other moderates in the race, hit Sanders over the cost of his health care and economic proposals.

“The math does not add up,” Klobuchar said of Sanders’ plans.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, argued that nominating a self-described Democratic socialist would hurt Democrats’ chances at flipping the Senate and defending their House majority in November.

“Let’s do some math ... It adds up to four more years of Donald Trump,” Buttigieg warned about a potential Sanders nomination.

He also pressed Sanders on the filibuster and his opposition to rewriting the Senate’s longstanding supermajority rule on legislation. “How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won’t even support a rule change?” Buttigieg asked.

Warren piled on, saying that “people like Bernie” have “given a veto” to the pharmaceutical and insurance industries by refusing to call for an end to the filibuster.

Sanders didn’t give an inch, staying on-message as he has in past debates. He said he would pay for his proposals through a tax on the wealthiest Americans, as well as some tax increases on the middle class he said would be offset by lower health care costs. The biggest misconception about his campaign, he added, is that “the ideas I’m talking about are radical. They’re not.”

The senator also defended his recent comments in which he praised aspects of Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba. “I have opposed authoritarian governments all over the world,” Sanders said Tuesday, arguing that they deserved praise when they do something right.

It’s not clear if Tuesday’s unorganized assault on Sanders will be enough to deny his path to the Democratic nomination, however. With the moderate lane in the race split between several candidates, Sanders is currently projected to take a huge lead in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states ― a lead that may be irreversible after next week.

"Police have arrested a 38-year-old black man from Orange Country, NY, for stabbing five Jews in the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey on the seventh night of Hanukkah. If you’re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you’re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?

The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.

The names given to the bogeymen of today’s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it’s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn’t enough, the left has also decided that Jews — a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population — are “hyper-white” and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.

It’s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it’s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.

On the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it’s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn’t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.

Trump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.

On the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn’t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.

The left’s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.

What’s more, unlike Trump, some of the left’s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn’t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.

But the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women’s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP’s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.

Historically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today’s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.

There is no man wearing a straw hat who is smoking a cigarette,"The Allahabad High Court has ruled that under special circumstances, a person apprehending arrest can move a high court directly seeking anticipatory bail without approaching a sessions court first.

A five-judge bench of the Allahabad High Court on Monday ruled that it is not mandatory that while filling an anticipatory bail under Section 438 of CrPC, an applicant must approach the sessions court first and on rejection of the plea move to the high court.

The bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and justices Ramesh Sinha, Sunita Agarwal, Yashwant Verma and Rahul Chaturvedi observed,""Section 438 CrPC on its plain terms does not mandate or require a party to first approach the sessions court before applying to the high court for grant of anticipatory bail.""



The matter came before the bench after reference by a single judge of the court in a case related to a plea of a man named Vinod Kumar.

The single judge had referred the matter to the larger bench asking, ""Whether the Court would have no jurisdiction to reject the anticipatory bail after considering the grounds of compelling reasons mentioned in the affidavit being found not appealing, which would amount nothing but to approach this Court directly.""



The larger bench was of the view, ""We would consequently answer the reference by holding that the decision in Vinod Kumar does not merit any reconsideration or explanation. As rightly held in that decision, there can be no exhaustive or general exposition of circumstances in which an applicant may be held entitled to approach the high court directly.""The bench further said that the special circumstances must be left for the consideration of the judge before whom the petition is placed and a decision thereon taken bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of that particular cause.

""However, special circumstances must necessarily exist and be established as such before the jurisdiction of the high court is invoked,"" it said.

fire destroys tibetan town in china,"MUMBAI: The much-awaited redevelopment of the Bombay Development Directorate (BDD) chawls at NM Joshi Marg will begin only after the draw of lots for rehab buildings, said an official with the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), on condition of anonymity. The state housing authority plans to conduct the draw of lots in a month’s time. However, the authority will finalise the date only once the ministry portfolios are distributed.

The official asserted that as cabinet expansion has taken place on December 30, the portfolios accumulated with the six cabinet ministers, who took oath along with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the first round, will now be distributed. Currently, NCP’s Jayant Patil is in charge of the housing ministry. Though a meeting was conducted with Minister Patil, only after portfolios are confirmed a detailed presentation about the BDD chawls’ redevelopment project will be made and the date for the draw of lots decided, explained the official.

Interestingly, the NM Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Phase-1 project construction work was expected to begin last year after Diwali. However, unable to vacate the first 10 chawls the project missed the deadline, and the plan failed to take off.

This paper had reported that in a bid to expedite the shifting of tenants, the MHADA has come up with an offer asking tenants to shift to transit houses wherein on first come first basis they will get an opportunity to participate in the lottery draw. By conducting this lottery draw, the participant tenants will know which floors of the new buildings their houses will be located. The lottery for rehab houses will be held from the top floors of the 22-storeyed building.

Besides, MHADA will also sign an agreement with the lottery winners, giving a surety that they will get their houses back, unlike the city’s other stuck redevelopment projects undertaken mostly by the private developers.

MHADA is drawing the lottery of top floor houses after tenants even after repeated appeals were not willing to leave their houses and shift to the provided alternative places. Following which, this offer was made in a bid to lure residents of getting houses on the top floors of the buildings once ready. So far, 252 families have shifted to the transit houses, informed the official.

At NM Joshi, the authority as per the approved plans will construct seven towers comprising 22 floors each in phase-1, which will house 1,200 tenements. To construct the seven new towers, 10 existing chawls are required to be demolished first.

The tenants of NM Joshi Marg, including Dadar-Naigaon BDD Chawl tenants, are provided alternative accommodation in mill buildings. Ruby Mill, Jubilee Mill, Prakash Cotton Mill, Western India Mill, Century Mill, and Bharat Mill are the six mills that have been identified and have a total of 1,127 transit houses, according to the MHADA.

The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had performed the ground-breaking ceremony in April 2017. However, till date, not a single brick has been laid. MHADA, on the other end, is still convincing residents to support the redevelopment of century-old BDD chawls, which have been planned costing of Rs 17,000 crore approximately. If successfully completed, about 16,000 families living in BDD chawls at NM Joshi, Naigaon and Worli will get new 500 square feet of flats free of cost.",0.5897298

"Researchers have found that combining neurologic and blood pressure drugs may reduce breast tumour development.

According to the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, adding a medication used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraines to a blood pressure medicine reversed some aspects of breast cancer in the offspring of mice at high risk of the disease because of the high fat diet fed to their mothers during pregnancy.

""We believe that our research is the first to show that we can reverse some aspects of increased breast cancer risk found in offspring of mouse mothers fed a high fat diet during pregnancy,"" said study researcher Leena A Hilakivi-Clarke from the Georgetown University in the US.

""This finding may have important implications in people because exposures in the womb to certain chemicals, or a mother's high fat diet, or being obese, can subsequently increase a daughter's breast cancer risk,"" Hilakivi-Clarke.

According to the researchers, the key drug in the study regimen was valproic acid which, among several targets, inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), an important epigenetic silencer of genes.

In contrast to mutations that permanently disrupt the normal functions of genes, epigenetic modifications are reversible.

Valproic acid was combined with the blood pressure medication hydralazine that inhibits another critical epigenetic regulator, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).

Early treatment studies in people have shown that these two drugs can work in tandem to disrupt tumour growth.

These research findings demonstrate how impactful an epigenetic methyl group addition or subtraction from DNA can be.

Compounds that reduce methylation of tumour suppressor genes that are excessively methylated (hypermethylated) can be beneficial.

However, these drugs can have the opposite effect if tumour suppressor genes are not hypermethylated; they may remove methyl groups from cancer-causing genes, making these genes more active and potentially leading to more aggressive cancers.

The other key aspect of this finding involves the potential impact of diet on cancer risk. Many fruits and vegetables have compounds (such as flavones) that chemically react in the same ways as the HDAC- and DNMT-inhibiting drugs in this study.

Some compounds in these foods, especially folic acid, have opposite effects.

This research suggests that exposure to a high fat diet or endocrine disrupting chemicals in the womb might be reversed by the consumption of foods high in DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, while those who have not had such exposures might also gain a cancer protective benefit from consuming foods high in folic acid.

The scientists noted, however, that their findings, particularly as they relate to diet, need to be studied in people.

""Our next step will be to try to identify biomarkers in humans that indicate an exposure in the womb to diets or endocrine disrupting chemicals that could increase breast cancer risk later in life,"" said Hilakivi-Clarke.

"Among the popular stars of the Gen-Z, Sara Ali Khan is the one who has filmmakers lining up to cast her in their films. Despite being just 3 films old, Sara enjoys a massive fan base and the star is considered to be one of the style icons of the youth. However, despite all of it, the gorgeous Love Aaj Kal star revealed that there was once a film narration that she wanted to escape at all costs and was even willing to fake a heart attack but her mom Amrita Singh talked sense into her.

Yes, in a candid conversation with East India Comedy, Sara revealed that once she was stuck in a very lengthy narration and the filmmaker was going on and on about the film.

"Britain said on Monday that China had questions to answer over the information it shared about the novel coronavirus outbreak, but refused to comment on reports that a U.S.-led intelligence consortium had accused Beijing of a cover-up.

The U.S. has scaled up its rhetoric over Chinese culpability for the coronavirus in recent days, with U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, saying on Sunday there was evidence the disease emerged from a Chinese lab.

Washington has so far presented no evidence publicly that the virus came from a lab, which Beijing strongly denies.

The Australian Telegraph reported the U.S.-led Five Eyes intelligence consortium had in a 15-page research dossier said China had deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus outbreak in an “assault on international transparency” that cost tens of thousands of lives.

The Five Eyes group compises U.S., British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand intelligence services.

British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Every day I get intelligence bulletins from our agencies around the world.

“I don’t comment on individual bulletins, what I have and haven’t seen. That would be wrong.”

Asked if China had questions to answer over how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the crisis, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “I think it does.”

“China needs to be open and transparent about what it leant, its short comings but also its successes,” Wallace said, adding that the time for a post mortem was after the outbreak.

Reuters has not seen the Five Eyes dossier and was unable to immediately verify the Australian Telegraph report.

One Western intelligence source said it was now widely accepted that China had not been fully transparent.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was confident the coronavirus originated in a Chinese virology lab.

“Virus samples ordered destroyed at genomics labs, wildlife market stalls bleached, the genome sequence not shared publicly, the Shanghai lab closure for ‘rectification’,” the Telegraph quoted the document as saying.

"The Allahabad High Court has ruled that under special circumstances, a person apprehending arrest can move a high court directly seeking anticipatory bail without approaching a sessions court first.

A five-judge bench of the Allahabad High Court on Monday ruled that it is not mandatory that while filling an anticipatory bail under Section 438 of CrPC, an applicant must approach the sessions court first and on rejection of the plea move to the high court.

The bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and justices Ramesh Sinha, Sunita Agarwal, Yashwant Verma and Rahul Chaturvedi observed,""Section 438 CrPC on its plain terms does not mandate or require a party to first approach the sessions court before applying to the high court for grant of anticipatory bail.""



The matter came before the bench after reference by a single judge of the court in a case related to a plea of a man named Vinod Kumar.

The single judge had referred the matter to the larger bench asking, ""Whether the Court would have no jurisdiction to reject the anticipatory bail after considering the grounds of compelling reasons mentioned in the affidavit being found not appealing, which would amount nothing but to approach this Court directly.""



The larger bench was of the view, ""We would consequently answer the reference by holding that the decision in Vinod Kumar does not merit any reconsideration or explanation. As rightly held in that decision, there can be no exhaustive or general exposition of circumstances in which an applicant may be held entitled to approach the high court directly.""The bench further said that the special circumstances must be left for the consideration of the judge before whom the petition is placed and a decision thereon taken bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of that particular cause.

""However, special circumstances must necessarily exist and be established as such before the jurisdiction of the high court is invoked,"" it said.

"TIM BROOKE-TAYLOR, who was best known as part of British comedy troupe The Goodies, has died aged 79 after contracting coronavirus.

A highly influential and prominent figure in the UK comedy scene for more than half a century, Brooke-Taylor's career encompassed work in radio, television, film and theatre.

While he was known for his 40 years of contributions to the Radio 4 panel show I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue, his lasting legacy is as one of the stars of The Goodies alongside Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie.

The anarchic TV comedy set in a flat shared by the three stars ran from 1970 to 1982 and drew in millions of viewers of all ages with its blend of wit and striking visual humour.

Children, meanwhile, may recall Brooke-Taylor as the narrator of the cult cartoon series Bananaman.

Brooke-Taylor's agent confirmed the news of his sad passing in a statement paying tribute to his life and work.

He said: ""It is with great sadness that we announce Tim's death early today from Covid-19.

""We will remember him for so much but must just mention The Goodies and I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue.

""He had, of course, many fans whom he always treated cheerfully even after long and exhausting rehearsals and recordings.

""He was an exceptional client and a pleasure to represent.""

Just heard the devastating news of the death of Tim Brooke-Taylor. A hero for as long as I can remember, and –on a few golden occasions – a colleague and collaborator on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Gentle, kind, funny, wise, warm, but piercingly witty when he chose to be. So sad — Stephen Fry (@stephenfry) April 12, 2020

Garden, his Goodies co-star, was among the first to pay tribute to his friend and fellow performer.

He said: ""I am terribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years.

""Tim and I met at Cambridge University in the early 1960s and have enjoyed working together almost constantly from that time onwards, on radio, stage, and TV.

""He was a funny, sociable, generous man who was a delight to work with. Audiences found him not only hilarious but also adorable.

""His loss at this dreadful time is particularly hard to bear, and my thoughts are with Christine, Ben, Edward and their families.""

He was joined by the likes of Stephen Fry, Jack Dee, Rob Brydon and David Walliams in paying their respects.

“I was obsessed with ‘The Goodies’ as a child, the first comedy show I really loved,” Walliams wrote.

“I queued up to get the Goodies’ autographs as a grown-up, and got to meet Tim Brooke-Taylor more recently at a party. I was in total awe, but he was so kind & generous. It is so sad he is gone.”

“So many happy times sat next to him on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue,” he added.

“My thoughts are with his family.”

Jack Dee, the current host of I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue also said: ""It has come as devastating news to hear that Tim has succumbed to this dreadful virus - especially when we all thought he was recovering.

""Tim was a delightful man and never anything but great company.""

"the bestowing of a franchise , enfranchisment","MUMBAI: The much-awaited redevelopment of the Bombay Development Directorate (BDD) chawls at NM Joshi Marg will begin only after the draw of lots for rehab buildings, said an official with the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), on condition of anonymity. The state housing authority plans to conduct the draw of lots in a month’s time. However, the authority will finalise the date only once the ministry portfolios are distributed.

The official asserted that as cabinet expansion has taken place on December 30, the portfolios accumulated with the six cabinet ministers, who took oath along with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the first round, will now be distributed. Currently, NCP’s Jayant Patil is in charge of the housing ministry. Though a meeting was conducted with Minister Patil, only after portfolios are confirmed a detailed presentation about the BDD chawls’ redevelopment project will be made and the date for the draw of lots decided, explained the official.

Interestingly, the NM Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Phase-1 project construction work was expected to begin last year after Diwali. However, unable to vacate the first 10 chawls the project missed the deadline, and the plan failed to take off.

This paper had reported that in a bid to expedite the shifting of tenants, the MHADA has come up with an offer asking tenants to shift to transit houses wherein on first come first basis they will get an opportunity to participate in the lottery draw. By conducting this lottery draw, the participant tenants will know which floors of the new buildings their houses will be located. The lottery for rehab houses will be held from the top floors of the 22-storeyed building.

Besides, MHADA will also sign an agreement with the lottery winners, giving a surety that they will get their houses back, unlike the city’s other stuck redevelopment projects undertaken mostly by the private developers.

MHADA is drawing the lottery of top floor houses after tenants even after repeated appeals were not willing to leave their houses and shift to the provided alternative places. Following which, this offer was made in a bid to lure residents of getting houses on the top floors of the buildings once ready. So far, 252 families have shifted to the transit houses, informed the official.

At NM Joshi, the authority as per the approved plans will construct seven towers comprising 22 floors each in phase-1, which will house 1,200 tenements. To construct the seven new towers, 10 existing chawls are required to be demolished first.

The tenants of NM Joshi Marg, including Dadar-Naigaon BDD Chawl tenants, are provided alternative accommodation in mill buildings. Ruby Mill, Jubilee Mill, Prakash Cotton Mill, Western India Mill, Century Mill, and Bharat Mill are the six mills that have been identified and have a total of 1,127 transit houses, according to the MHADA.

The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had performed the ground-breaking ceremony in April 2017. However, till date, not a single brick has been laid. MHADA, on the other end, is still convincing residents to support the redevelopment of century-old BDD chawls, which have been planned costing of Rs 17,000 crore approximately.

"Britain said on Monday that China had questions to answer over the information it shared about the novel coronavirus outbreak, but refused to comment on reports that a U.S.-led intelligence consortium had accused Beijing of a cover-up.

The U.S. has scaled up its rhetoric over Chinese culpability for the coronavirus in recent days, with U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, saying on Sunday there was evidence the disease emerged from a Chinese lab.

Washington has so far presented no evidence publicly that the virus came from a lab, which Beijing strongly denies.

The Australian Telegraph reported the U.S.-led Five Eyes intelligence consortium had in a 15-page research dossier said China had deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus outbreak in an “assault on international transparency” that cost tens of thousands of lives.

The Five Eyes group compises U.S., British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand intelligence services.

British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Every day I get intelligence bulletins from our agencies around the world.

“I don’t comment on individual bulletins, what I have and haven’t seen. That would be wrong.”

Asked if China had questions to answer over how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the crisis, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “I think it does.”

“China needs to be open and transparent about what it leant, its short comings but also its successes,” Wallace said, adding that the time for a post mortem was after the outbreak.

Reuters has not seen the Five Eyes dossier and was unable to immediately verify the Australian Telegraph report.

One Western intelligence source said it was now widely accepted that China had not been fully transparent.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was confident the coronavirus originated in a Chinese virology lab.

“Virus samples ordered destroyed at genomics labs, wildlife market stalls bleached, the genome sequence not shared publicly, the Shanghai lab closure for ‘rectification’,” the Telegraph quoted the document as saying.

"The Allahabad High Court has ruled that under special circumstances, a person apprehending arrest can move a high court directly seeking anticipatory bail without approaching a sessions court first.

A five-judge bench of the Allahabad High Court on Monday ruled that it is not mandatory that while filling an anticipatory bail under Section 438 of CrPC, an applicant must approach the sessions court first and on rejection of the plea move to the high court.

The bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and justices Ramesh Sinha, Sunita Agarwal, Yashwant Verma and Rahul Chaturvedi observed,""Section 438 CrPC on its plain terms does not mandate or require a party to first approach the sessions court before applying to the high court for grant of anticipatory bail.""



The matter came before the bench after reference by a single judge of the court in a case related to a plea of a man named Vinod Kumar.

The single judge had referred the matter to the larger bench asking, ""Whether the Court would have no jurisdiction to reject the anticipatory bail after considering the grounds of compelling reasons mentioned in the affidavit being found not appealing, which would amount nothing but to approach this Court directly.""



The larger bench was of the view, ""We would consequently answer the reference by holding that the decision in Vinod Kumar does not merit any reconsideration or explanation. As rightly held in that decision, there can be no exhaustive or general exposition of circumstances in which an applicant may be held entitled to approach the high court directly.""The bench further said that the special circumstances must be left for the consideration of the judge before whom the petition is placed and a decision thereon taken bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of that particular cause.

""However, special circumstances must necessarily exist and be established as such before the jurisdiction of the high court is invoked,"" it said.

"AGRA: An armed man with a criminal background, Subhash Batham, held at least 22 children hostage at his daughter’s birthday party who was later killed in police action in a village located in India’s Uttar Pradesh.

Subhash Batham, an accused in a murder case who was out on bail, held at least 22 children hostage after inviting them to his house for a birthday party of his daughter in Kathariya village in Uttar Pradesh’s Farukkhabad.

One person was injured in his leg by a gunshot when some of the residents tried to open the door. Later, Batham had also hurled a crude bomb and fired gunshots on villagers and policemen rushed to rescue the children.

Some reports said Batham held the children hostages, who were aged between six months and 15 years, for being wrongly framed in a murder case and wanted to pressurise the authorities for dropping the criminal charges against him.

A local police officer told media that security personnel took the action with extreme caution in order to ensure the safety of the children locked inside the house.

After the overnight stand-off, a special team of trained policemen and commandos killed him in a shoot-out, while two officers were also wounded in the operation.

The hostages were rescued by the security team without any injury.

According to the reports, Batham’s wife was also killed on Thursday night, after villagers reportedly beat her to death and threw stones at her when she attempted to run away from the scene.
