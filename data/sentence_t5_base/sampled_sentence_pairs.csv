A young girl in a bikini is sitting on the beach,"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.5962659

A young man deep in thought.,"It took six years, but fans of ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" will finally be getting the show's long-awaited seventh and final season.

The six-year wait for “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” Season 7 is nearly over. The first episode of the series’ final season will premiere on Disney+ on Friday, February 21, and Disney has unveiled a new clip and several images to hype up the beginning of the end.

Like the show itself, Season 7 will focus on the end of the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars that defined much of the franchise’s mythology. The new clip from “The Bad Batch” teases a team-up with a squad of “favorably mutated” clone troopers, who will kick off the season with a mission behind Separatist lines.

Per Disney: “The forces of darkness have amassed great power in their bid to transform the Republic into the Galactic Empire. With the Republic on a losing streak, Captain Rex fears the Separatists are using stolen data to help predict the Grand Army’s every move. As the threat of defeat looms, Rex teams up with experimental Clone Force 99, also known as the Bad Batch. Together, they embark on a high-risk mission behind enemy lines to uncover the truth behind the Separatist victories.”

While the series’ new clip is focused on the Clone Troopers, plenty of fan-favorite Force users will be returning throughout the upcoming season, including Anakin Skywalker, Darth Maul, and Ahsoka Tano.

Disney

“The Bad Batch” was intended to kick off Season 7 several years ago before production on the series was stopped. The episode would’ve been part of a four-episode arc. One of the series’ writers released plot details about the story arc in 2014, when the series’ future was uncertain — and unfinished story reels were also released — but only time will tell how the experimental Clone Troopers play into the overall series.

The seventh season of “The Clone Wars” will premiere a few months after Dave Filoni’s Disney+ tentpole “The Mandalorian” hit the streamer. Filoni served as creator and showrunner on “Star Wars Rebels” and is the showrunner for “The Clone Wars.” Like his animated series, “The Mandalorian,” which will return for a second season in October, enjoyed stellar fan reception.

“The Mandalorian” Season 1 finale teased that the Darksaber, a black-bladed lightsaber that originated in “The Clone Wars,” would play a significant role in future installments. Given the interconnected nature of recent “Star Wars” projects — and Disney’s need to keep the franchise in the public eye — don’t be surprised if similar teases pop up in the upcoming “The Clone Wars” season.

Two men in business dress are standing by the side of a road.,"A firm owned by Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve's son and wife was awarded a contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.

However, when Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""



The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

"Now that the 2020s are officially upon us, it's only natural to wonder what the next decade of PC gaming will bring. Better graphics and faster hardware are a given, but considering how blindsided we were by some of the past decade's biggest, weirdest surprises —like loot boxes, Steam Early Access, and battle royales—it's also a safe bet that 2020 will have some strange surprises of its own. So everyone at PC Gamer is dusting off their crystal balls to try and predict some of the biggest stories and trends that will happen over the next 10 years.

Riot becomes the new Blizzard

Robin: Blizzard’s fortunes have seemed increasingly shaky over the last couple of years. Just when you thought the most unpopular thing they’d do in the decade was announce a mobile game, they decided to spark an international incident. Stories from inside the studio are troubling, too, with reports implying that the company culture may have been changing for the worse for years. Meanwhile, Riot’s made its play, announcing a billion games and an entire multi-media empire in one press conference. I don’t think all its gambles will pay off, but I could easily see its star being more ascendant than ever over the next ten years, while Blizzard’s increasingly dwindles.

Fraser: Riot’s had even more issues that Blizzard, and while it’s designing several games that will inevitably compete with Blizzard’s, I don’t think it’s ever going to reach the same heights. It’s arguably been squandered, but Blizzard’s long legacy is part of the reason that, even now, it’s beloved by a legion of fans, whereas Riot has one game that’s infamous for its toxic community. I’m not sure how Blizzard is going to come out of the next decade and I wouldn’t be surprised if its popularity did dwindle, but I’m don’t think anything will replace it.

Steven: Sorry, Fraser. I'm with Robin on this one. That one game you mentioned also happens to be the world's most popular with a daily player count that probably beats every Blizzard game combined. Toxic community notwithstanding, I think Riot's aggressive expansion is similar to Marvel's Cinematic Universe and has all the potential to be just as popular.

BioWare fades away

James: Dragon Age 4 sounds nice, but it can't land too short of Modern Classic if BioWare wants to bring back its former reputation as one of the better big-budget storytellers in games. With so many new vacancies left by longtime employees and the constant shuffling around of those who remain, my faith in BioWare's delivery is at an all time low. To be clear, I'm not hopeless, I'm just... not optimistic.

Steven: I agree. I think this tail-end of the 2010s has shown that nothing gold can stay and sometimes beloved studios lose their way. With BioWare, I'm increasingly worried that they're no longer the studio I fell in love with 20 years ago. There's too much riding on Dragon Age 4, and that makes me worried that if BioWare cracks under the pressure again it'll be another Anthem-like disaster.

VR finally breaks through

Tyler: VR won't replace screens—that'd mean the death of popular genres, and be totally inaccessible for some—but by 2030 it will be much more popular. All-in-one headsets with built-in tracking will accurately detect the movements of our feet, hands, and joints, as well as our facial expressions, making our Sonic meme avatars extremely lifelike.

James: I'm not convinced. I mean, I think it will be more affordable and accessible, but I think the inconveniences will quickly outweigh the novelty. Wearing a big headset, closing yourself off to your surroundings, holding a bright magnified image inches from your eyes—the effect is astounding, for a while at least. And then it's exhausting. And then normal. The adoption rate will swell and deflate with every incremental update or 'killer app' until the promise of a virtual world isn't all that exciting anymore. Half-Life: Alyx will be great, though.

Chris: Maybe, but I think it's still going to give a lot of people motion sickness, which is something that might get even worse as the fidelity of VR gets better. That means a lot of people will still be slowly teleporting around inside games rather than using normal locomotion because it just messes with our brains and bodies in ways that no amount of technology can solve. Motion sickness is going to continue to keep VR a niche interest and a cool novelty rather than a breakout phenomenon.

Ray tracing and 4K become the new standard

Tyler: At the start of the '10s, people were complaining about not being able to read text on their SD TVs. In the decade that followed, 1080p became normal, and then 4K TVs became normal. Still, true 4K gaming (as in, no upscaling) is considered high-end today. This is a boring, conservative prediction, but I'm going to say that'll happen again: 4K fully replaces 1080p and 1440p sometime in the '20s, and by the end of the decade, 8K and up are the high-end choices.

James: I'm too dumb to nod my head at the ray-tracing bit, but I'm fairly certain 4K will be the new 1080p. Just 10 years ago, the most popular resolution was 1280x800 . We're on pace to make 4K the norm. But what then? 4K is enough, right? What then?

PC hardware advances will slow way down

Jarred: I'm going to piggyback off Tyler here, but focus on processors and manufacturing technologies. The fun prediction would be to assume Moore's Law is alive and well and computers continue to progress in leaps and bounds. The reality: we're hitting a wall. Actually, we've been hitting walls for the past decade, but each new wall becomes taller and thicker. Ten years ago, a state-of-the-art CPU was manufactured on 45nm tech, and GPUs were on 55nm. We've gone through three or four transitions since then (32nm, 22nm, 14nm, and kind of 10nm for Intel; 40nm, 28nm, 16/12nm, and 7nm for TSMC). Ten years from now, I expect three transitions at most (eg, 5nm, 4nm, and 3nm), but the real improvements from each process shrink will become less noticeable. A Core i9-9900K or Ryzen 9 3900X will still be doing okay, but your graphics card will have been upgraded several times, because 4K 144Hz gaming isn't happening on today's GPUs.

James: The time for smellovision is nigh.

The most popular game is from a genre we've never heard of

Tyler: Battle royale games didn't exist in 2010. Neither did autobattlers like Dota Auto Chess. Roguelikes were just starting to make a comeback as 'roguelites'. No one was using 'walking simulator' as a term of endearment or criticism. No one was searching for the term 'soulslike' until 2015. There were no 'strand games' that I can recall, because it's something Hideo Kojima made up. Only time will tell if he's on to something.

James: Like, what's going to be so new that Fortnite kids think it's too obtuse or naive to get into? I couldn't have predicted Fortnite, but I'm thinking whatever comes next will come from the increased scale and level of simulation new technologies will allow. Better graphics aren't the thing, I'm thinking about how the novelty of 100 people shooting each other on an island was enough to birth BR. Layer in way more and much deeper systems, be it weather, physics, building, lighting—whatever really—and the new ideas will spill out of the dev scene and onto the internet. That's my aspirational take. It'll actually be something that emerges from dumb luck.

We won't buy PC games anymore

Harry: Ok, hear me out. I'm not saying we're all just going to up and put down our mouse and keyboards en masse, but by the end of 2030, individually buying games to keep will just seem weird. Services like Xbox Game Pass for PC will be joined by others looking for a lucrative slice of the subscription-service pie, and become ubiquitous. Just like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu did for the small screen, we'll be juggling various Game Pass-like products and never really own anything. Because we're millennials and don't deserve to.

Rachel: I don't think we'll buy PC games anymore because I feel a majority of games will choose to take the free-to-play route. Many of the biggest games right now are free-to-play and I reckon this style of business model will be an overwhelming majority in 2030. Fortnite's micropayments model has overwhelmingly proven that it's a viable route for gaming companies. Instead of buying games, the focus will turn more to buying in-game virtual goods and premium features.

Dwarf Fortress simulates meta consciousness, dwarves realize they're inside the simulation

Dwarf Fortress creator Tarn Adams has said he wants to simulate all the ""narratively interesting"" aspects of existence, and I'm betting that means we'll 100 percent have a Dwarf Fortress Truman Show moment sometime in the next decade. Dwarves already have complex mental and emotional states, so it's not a leap to imagine them becoming self-aware enough to realize they're fictional beings inside a massive simulation. The question is, what will the do when they find out?

Loot boxes will be a thing of the past

Robin: Though some of their stealthier forms might survive—‘card packs’, for example—I think your run-of-the-mill loot boxes aren’t long for this world. There’s just too much scrutiny on them these days. If government regulation doesn’t kill them, publisher skittishness will, and they’ll end up banished to the same graveyard online passes got chucked in. The catch? I think they’ll be replaced by something even more insidious.

James: Loot boxes will just get supplanted by data collection psyops. Destiny 2 is almost already there, a collection of feedback systems on a micro and macro level, from the recoil after pulling the trigger and the gas escaping from where the Cabal's head used to be to the little sound and animation that plays when turning in a bounty. Service based games are endless fonts of granular information, so the structures to tune player experiences to the individual will likely take shape. Attention will become a higher priority than how microtransactions are presented. We might see them disappear completely.

Bethesda will stop making singleplayer games altogether

Chris: Bethesda will release Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6 at some point in the next decade, but after that? I wouldn't be completely surprised if we never saw another traditional singleplayer RPG developed by the studio. I don't much care for Fallout 76, and I'm not alone. But there must be tons of people still playing it because it keeps chugging along, and even the resoundingly unpopular Fallout 1st subscription has plenty members—pop into a session and you're bound to come across a few. I expect Bethesda will get better at making online games this coming decade, and if they do the focus will drift away from singleplayer RPGS entirely.","if you want to buy $ billion in xyz inc. common stock , who cares ?",0.73820853
"Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a £9 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to £2,500 a month to help them cope with the effects of coronavirus.

The Chancellor tonight said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, will cover 80 per cent of a self-employed person's average monthly profits.

But it may not be available until June and will only be available to those who have a tax return for 2019, meaning the newly self-employed will be ineligible.

And Mr Sunak warned that the self-employed could face tax hikes in the future as part of the effort to ""right the ship"" and repair the battered public finances after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Details of the scheme came as the Department of Health announced a total of 578 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK have died as of 5pm on March 25.

Some 11,658 people have tested positive in the UK as of 9am on March 26.

Mr Sunak's scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

To qualify, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.

Up to 3.8 million people will qualify for support, with average monthly payments expected to be £940 per person.

Mr Sunak said the scheme, which will last for at least three months, ""is one of the most generous in the world"".

""It targets support to those who need help most, offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work.""

He said the measure covers 95 per cent of people who receive the majority of their income from self-employment.

But in a hint that the self-employed could be asked to pay more to the taxman in future he said it was ""now much harder to justify"" the tax breaks on offer to the self-employed if they were receiving the same level of state support.

He said everyone would be ""chipping in together to right the ship afterwards"" once the crisis is over.

A number of self-employed workers welcomed the Chancellor's measures but expressed concern about having to wait until June to claim.

Louise Barina, a production manager who lives in London, said: ""After having spoken to our landlord, he has outright said no, that we can't get a delay on our rent.

""In terms of the payment coming in June, that's really problematic for us as that's obviously three months of payment where we need to find the money for that.""

Meanwhile the Department of Health said revising its reporting approach for coronavirus deaths ""to ensure data can be verified and published in a timely, consistent way"".

A statement on Twitter said: ""Figures issued today are recorded as of 5pm on March 24 to 5pm on March 25.

""Going forwards, figures on deaths will be recorded for the 24-hour period as of 5pm the previous day. Figures on tests remain as of the 24-hour period from 9am that day.""","two kuwaitis and six palestinians with jordanian passports were among the suspects , the official said .",0.73872995
"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",at least 20 dead in somalia attacks,0.73924816

Oncogenic KRAS mutations are common in cancer.,"Gains made in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission could be reversed due to interruptions caused by Covid-19.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”",0.76004606

However, when Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""



The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”",0.7954025

Oh, pasta. Whether you’re more of a linguini lover or mad for macaroni, there’s really nothing like a hearty helping of the feel-good dish.

You might be prepared to give up a lot for veganuary 2020 – where people try to go vegan for a month – and you might think you can just get away with not sprinkling cheese on top of your beloved pasta, but what is pasta actually made from?

Brace yourself and read on to find out whether or not vegans can eat pasta…

Is pasta vegan?

Like so many things in life, there isn’t a clear yes or no – it depends on the type of pasta you’re eating.

When it comes to pasta, there’s usually two types: fresh pasta and pasta secca (aka dried pasta).

Hnnng (Picture: Getty)

Fresh pasta is usually made and cooked in the same setting and is usually not vegan because it can contain eggs, whereas dry pasta is nearly always vegan.

If you’re making dry pasta for yourself at home, double-check the packaging but you’re most likely not going to fail veganuary as a result.

If you’re eating pasta out at a restaurant, ask if the fresh pasta was made with eggs or oil.

Giving up fresh pasta might be worth it though – especially if you want to boost your erections.

Netflix documentary The Game Changers tested athletes to try out a vegan diet, and by switching to a plant-based diet, their eggplants noticed the difference, standing tall for up to 500% longer in one case.

How is fresh pasta made?

The typical ingredients for fresh pasta include flour, water, salt, and eggs – note that some fresh pasta can be made with oil instead of eggs, but it’s more likely than not to be made with eggs.

First, the flour and salt are mixed together in a mixing bowl before a well is made in the middle of the flour.

This is when the eggs are normally added; they’re cracked right inside the centre of the flour well.

The flour is mixed into the eggs until a dough forms.

Once that’s done, the dough is cut into the pasta shape of choice.

You can buy vegan fresh pasta alternatives from most major supermarkets, including Waitrose’s vegan ravioli and Sainsburys’ non-egg spaghetti and shroomballs.

How is dried pasta made?

The majority of dried pasta, on the other hand, is vegan and made from just two ingredients.

Most mass-produced dried pastas – which you can buy from supermarkets – contain just flour and semolina.

Semolina, derived from a wheat product, is first mixed with water. This mixture then gets processed in bulk quantities by machines creating a sort of dough.

This dough is then pressed through pasta molds to get the intended shape.

However, when Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""



The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

"CLARK COUNTY, Ohio -- Health officials have identified 20 cases of COVID-19 linked to a Dole Fresh Vegetables packing plant in Clark County, Ohio.



Of the 20 cases, 12 are Dole employees (10 confirmed and two probable); eight are contacts of employees (five confirmed and three probable); and three cases involve people who do not live in Clark County, according to a statement released by the Clark County Combined Health District Tuesday, May 19.







The health district on Monday announced it was monitoring the first workplace outbreak in Clark County, and Tuesday, officials identified Dole as the company, according to the Springfield News-Sun.



In a statement to local news station WDTN, Dole maintained that the company has been in constant contact with the packing location since the potential outbreak was initially reported back in April:



“In addition to implementing all public health recommended precautions—social distancing, extensive hand washing, wearing of face masks at all times in our facilities, mandated self-quarantining of employees and contractors exposed to COVID-positive individuals, and increased frequency of deep cleaning and sanitation at the facility, especially in high touch areas—Dole has additionally welcomed CCCHD to come into and inspect the Springfield Salad Facility. Following the inspection, during which CCCHD noted the many protective procedures implemented by Dole, the facility implemented additional protocols based on their suggestions to further increase the safety of our employees and contractors. These include greater distancing and separation of workers in our facility, table dividers installed in our cafeteria and similar dividers in our packing room for added protection.""



Despite implementing additional safety measures, 10 Dole salad plant employees and contractors at the Ohio packing plant tested positive for COVID-19, according to the statement.



“We cannot state with certainty how the transmission occurred, but these results lead us to believe that the plant is not the source of transmission. No matter how the transmission occurred, however, Dole will continue to place employee health and well-being above all else in our efforts to keep fresh salads on shelves across the nation,“ the statement concluded.","The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.8675226
"Now that the 2020s are officially upon us, it's only natural to wonder what the next decade of PC gaming will bring. Better graphics and faster hardware are a given, but considering how blindsided we were by some of the past decade's biggest, weirdest surprises —like loot boxes, Steam Early Access, and battle royales—it's also a safe bet that 2020 will have some strange surprises of its own. So everyone at PC Gamer is dusting off their crystal balls to try and predict some of the biggest stories and trends that will happen over the next 10 years.

Riot becomes the new Blizzard

Robin: Blizzard’s fortunes have seemed increasingly shaky over the last couple of years. Just when you thought the most unpopular thing they’d do in the decade was announce a mobile game, they decided to spark an international incident. Stories from inside the studio are troubling, too, with reports implying that the company culture may have been changing for the worse for years. Meanwhile, Riot’s made its play, announcing a billion games and an entire multi-media empire in one press conference. I don’t think all its gambles will pay off, but I could easily see its star being more ascendant than ever over the next ten years, while Blizzard’s increasingly dwindles.

Fraser: Riot’s had even more issues that Blizzard, and while it’s designing several games that will inevitably compete with Blizzard’s, I don’t think it’s ever going to reach the same heights. It’s arguably been squandered, but Blizzard’s long legacy is part of the reason that, even now, it’s beloved by a legion of fans, whereas Riot has one game that’s infamous for its toxic community. I’m not sure how Blizzard is going to come out of the next decade and I wouldn’t be surprised if its popularity did dwindle, but I’m don’t think anything will replace it.

Steven: Sorry, Fraser. I'm with Robin on this one. That one game you mentioned also happens to be the world's most popular with a daily player count that probably beats every Blizzard game combined. Toxic community notwithstanding, I think Riot's aggressive expansion is similar to Marvel's Cinematic Universe and has all the potential to be just as popular.

BioWare fades away

James: Dragon Age 4 sounds nice, but it can't land too short of Modern Classic if BioWare wants to bring back its former reputation as one of the better big-budget storytellers in games. With so many new vacancies left by longtime employees and the constant shuffling around of those who remain, my faith in BioWare's delivery is at an all time low. To be clear, I'm not hopeless, I'm just... not optimistic.

Steven: I agree. I think this tail-end of the 2010s has shown that nothing gold can stay and sometimes beloved studios lose their way. With BioWare, I'm increasingly worried that they're no longer the studio I fell in love with 20 years ago. There's too much riding on Dragon Age 4, and that makes me worried that if BioWare cracks under the pressure again it'll be another Anthem-like disaster.

VR finally breaks through

Tyler: VR won't replace screens—that'd mean the death of popular genres, and be totally inaccessible for some—but by 2030 it will be much more popular. All-in-one headsets with built-in tracking will accurately detect the movements of our feet, hands, and joints, as well as our facial expressions, making our Sonic meme avatars extremely lifelike.

James: I'm not convinced. I mean, I think it will be more affordable and accessible, but I think the inconveniences will quickly outweigh the novelty. Wearing a big headset, closing yourself off to your surroundings, holding a bright magnified image inches from your eyes—the effect is astounding, for a while at least. And then it's exhausting. And then normal. The adoption rate will swell and deflate with every incremental update or 'killer app' until the promise of a virtual world isn't all that exciting anymore. Half-Life: Alyx will be great, though.

Chris: Maybe, but I think it's still going to give a lot of people motion sickness, which is something that might get even worse as the fidelity of VR gets better. That means a lot of people will still be slowly teleporting around inside games rather than using normal locomotion because it just messes with our brains and bodies in ways that no amount of technology can solve. Motion sickness is going to continue to keep VR a niche interest and a cool novelty rather than a breakout phenomenon.

Ray tracing and 4K become the new standard

Tyler: At the start of the '10s, people were complaining about not being able to read text on their SD TVs. In the decade that followed, 1080p became normal, and then 4K TVs became normal. Still, true 4K gaming (as in, no upscaling) is considered high-end today. This is a boring, conservative prediction, but I'm going to say that'll happen again: 4K fully replaces 1080p and 1440p sometime in the '20s, and by the end of the decade, 8K and up are the high-end choices.

James: I'm too dumb to nod my head at the ray-tracing bit, but I'm fairly certain 4K will be the new 1080p. Just 10 years ago, the most popular resolution was 1280x800 . We're on pace to make 4K the norm. But what then? 4K is enough, right? What then?

PC hardware advances will slow way down

Jarred: I'm going to piggyback off Tyler here, but focus on processors and manufacturing technologies. The fun prediction would be to assume Moore's Law is alive and well and computers continue to progress in leaps and bounds. The reality: we're hitting a wall. Actually, we've been hitting walls for the past decade, but each new wall becomes taller and thicker. Ten years ago, a state-of-the-art CPU was manufactured on 45nm tech, and GPUs were on 55nm. We've gone through three or four transitions since then (32nm, 22nm, 14nm, and kind of 10nm for Intel; 40nm, 28nm, 16/12nm, and 7nm for TSMC). Ten years from now, I expect three transitions at most (eg, 5nm, 4nm, and 3nm), but the real improvements from each process shrink will become less noticeable. A Core i9-9900K or Ryzen 9 3900X will still be doing okay, but your graphics card will have been upgraded several times, because 4K 144Hz gaming isn't happening on today's GPUs.

James: The time for smellovision is nigh.

The most popular game is from a genre we've never heard of

Tyler: Battle royale games didn't exist in 2010. Neither did autobattlers like Dota Auto Chess. Roguelikes were just starting to make a comeback as 'roguelites'. No one was using 'walking simulator' as a term of endearment or criticism. No one was searching for the term 'soulslike' until 2015. There were no 'strand games' that I can recall, because it's something Hideo Kojima made up. Only time will tell if he's on to something.

James: Like, what's going to be so new that Fortnite kids think it's too obtuse or naive to get into? I couldn't have predicted Fortnite, but I'm thinking whatever comes next will come from the increased scale and level of simulation new technologies will allow. Better graphics aren't the thing, I'm thinking about how the novelty of 100 people shooting each other on an island was enough to birth BR. Layer in way more and much deeper systems, be it weather, physics, building, lighting—whatever really—and the new ideas will spill out of the dev scene and onto the internet. That's my aspirational take. It'll actually be something that emerges from dumb luck.

We won't buy PC games anymore

Harry: Ok, hear me out. I'm not saying we're all just going to up and put down our mouse and keyboards en masse, but by the end of 2030, individually buying games to keep will just seem weird. Services like Xbox Game Pass for PC will be joined by others looking for a lucrative slice of the subscription-service pie, and become ubiquitous. Just like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu did for the small screen, we'll be juggling various Game Pass-like products and never really own anything. Because we're millennials and don't deserve to.

Rachel: I don't think we'll buy PC games anymore because I feel a majority of games will choose to take the free-to-play route. Many of the biggest games right now are free-to-play and I reckon this style of business model will be an overwhelming majority in 2030. Fortnite's micropayments model has overwhelmingly proven that it's a viable route for gaming companies. Instead of buying games, the focus will turn more to buying in-game virtual goods and premium features.

Dwarf Fortress simulates meta consciousness, dwarves realize they're inside the simulation

Dwarf Fortress creator Tarn Adams has said he wants to simulate all the ""narratively interesting"" aspects of existence, and I'm betting that means we'll 100 percent have a Dwarf Fortress Truman Show moment sometime in the next decade. Dwarves already have complex mental and emotional states, so it's not a leap to imagine them becoming self-aware enough to realize they're fictional beings inside a massive simulation. The question is, what will the do when they find out?

Loot boxes will be a thing of the past

Robin: Though some of their stealthier forms might survive—‘card packs’, for example—I think your run-of-the-mill loot boxes aren’t long for this world. There’s just too much scrutiny on them these days. If government regulation doesn’t kill them, publisher skittishness will, and they’ll end up banished to the same graveyard online passes got chucked in. The catch? I think they’ll be replaced by something even more insidious.

James: Loot boxes will just get supplanted by data collection psyops. Destiny 2 is almost already there, a collection of feedback systems on a micro and macro level, from the recoil after pulling the trigger and the gas escaping from where the Cabal's head used to be to the little sound and animation that plays when turning in a bounty. Service based games are endless fonts of granular information, so the structures to tune player experiences to the individual will likely take shape. Attention will become a higher priority than how microtransactions are presented. We might see them disappear completely.

Bethesda will stop making singleplayer games altogether

Chris: Bethesda will release Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6 at some point in the next decade, but after that? I wouldn't be completely surprised if we never saw another traditional singleplayer RPG developed by the studio. I don't much care for Fallout 76, and I'm not alone. But there must be tons of people still playing it because it keeps chugging along, and even the resoundingly unpopular Fallout 1st subscription has plenty members—pop into a session and you're bound to come across a few. I expect Bethesda will get better at making online games this coming decade, and if they do the focus will drift away from singleplayer RPGS entirely.","Forgive the obvious pun, but our vision for 2020 starts here.

As a news organization, it’s AIN’s job to stick to reporting on what has already happened. One exception is this time, every year. In the following segments, you’ll read what we believe to be the outlook for key elements of our industry for the next 12 months—views inevitably shaped by the past, but with an eye toward what we believe is just beyond the immediate horizon.

You’ll get our take on the immediate future of eVTOL, not the lofty aspirations of the over-optimistic, but the cold reality; the bubbling cauldron of election-year politics as it impacts our industry; 2020’s outlook for what’s in line for the FBO industry; what’s on tap for OEMs in an ever-volatile market; avionics in the wake of the ADS-B (soft?) deadline; and what you can expect to see on the shop floors—and in the order books—of MROs.

So, how did we do last year? Here are some samples of what we were projecting for 2019:

eVTOL: “Even if eVTOLs win public acceptance and clear regulatory and technological hurdles, can OEMs and service providers deliver the technology at a price the general public can afford?” That remains the biggest open question in aviation.



Touchscreens: “It won’t be a surprise to see more manufacturers adopting this technology, especially as younger tech-savvy pilots move up the flying food chain to more sophisticated aircraft.” Twelve months later, that seems on track.

Supersonics: “Through 2019, Aerion and its partners will be initiating the process of selecting Tier 1 suppliers for the next phase of development.” This predated the February 2019 announcement of Boeing’s investment and involvement in the AS2 project. Since then, the program has gone largely silent.

Come January 2021, we’ll take another look back at this year’s look forward.",0.86826956

"Another positive case of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been reported in Mason County. A man in his 70s became the 18th County resident to test positive. Mason County Public Health was notified of the latest positive test on Wednesday, April 9, 2020. Mason County Public Health is conducting contact interviews at this time. The patient is currently isolating at home.

Case information for the 18 positive cases is as follows:

Only one patient has been hospitalized outside Mason County. The remaining patients are isolating at home.

So far, 502 people have been tested in Mason County.

Due to Mason County being a small community, location data of positive cases will not be released to reduce the possibility of patient identification and to protect personal health information. Identified positive cases are located throughout Mason County. To avoid exposure, continue to follow the guidance of washing hands frequently, stay home, unless essential to work and limit travel to only medical appointments, medication pick up, and once every two-week grocery shopping needs. This will help limit your exposure possibilities.

"CLARK COUNTY, Ohio -- Health officials have identified 20 cases of COVID-19 linked to a Dole Fresh Vegetables packing plant in Clark County, Ohio.



Of the 20 cases, 12 are Dole employees (10 confirmed and two probable); eight are contacts of employees (five confirmed and three probable); and three cases involve people who do not live in Clark County, according to a statement released by the Clark County Combined Health District Tuesday, May 19.







The health district on Monday announced it was monitoring the first workplace outbreak in Clark County, and Tuesday, officials identified Dole as the company, according to the Springfield News-Sun.



In a statement to local news station WDTN, Dole maintained that the company has been in constant contact with the packing location since the potential outbreak was initially reported back in April:



“In addition to implementing all public health recommended precautions—social distancing, extensive hand washing, wearing of face masks at all times in our facilities, mandated self-quarantining of employees and contractors exposed to COVID-positive individuals, and increased frequency of deep cleaning and sanitation at the facility, especially in high touch areas—Dole has additionally welcomed CCCHD to come into and inspect the Springfield Salad Facility. Following the inspection, during which CCCHD noted the many protective procedures implemented by Dole, the facility implemented additional protocols based on their suggestions to further increase the safety of our employees and contractors. These include greater distancing and separation of workers in our facility, table dividers installed in our cafeteria and similar dividers in our packing room for added protection.""



Despite implementing additional safety measures, 10 Dole salad plant employees and contractors at the Ohio packing plant tested positive for COVID-19, according to the statement.



“We cannot state with certainty how the transmission occurred, but these results lead us to believe that the plant is not the source of transmission. No matter how the transmission occurred, however, Dole will continue to place employee health and well-being above all else in our efforts to keep fresh salads on shelves across the nation,“ the statement concluded.","Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a £9 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to £2,500 a month to help them cope with the effects of coronavirus.

The Chancellor tonight said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, will cover 80 per cent of a self-employed person's average monthly profits.

But it may not be available until June and will only be available to those who have a tax return for 2019, meaning the newly self-employed will be ineligible.

And Mr Sunak warned that the self-employed could face tax hikes in the future as part of the effort to ""right the ship"" and repair the battered public finances after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Details of the scheme came as the Department of Health announced a total of 578 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK have died as of 5pm on March 25.

Some 11,658 people have tested positive in the UK as of 9am on March 26.

Mr Sunak's scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

To qualify, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.

Up to 3.8 million people will qualify for support, with average monthly payments expected to be £940 per person.

Mr Sunak said the scheme, which will last for at least three months, ""is one of the most generous in the world"".

""It targets support to those who need help most, offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work.""

He said the measure covers 95 per cent of people who receive the majority of their income from self-employment.

But in a hint that the self-employed could be asked to pay more to the taxman in future he said it was ""now much harder to justify"" the tax breaks on offer to the self-employed if they were receiving the same level of state support.

He said everyone would be ""chipping in together to right the ship afterwards"" once the crisis is over.

A number of self-employed workers welcomed the Chancellor's measures but expressed concern about having to wait until June to claim.

Louise Barina, a production manager who lives in London, said: ""After having spoken to our landlord, he has outright said no, that we can't get a delay on our rent.

""In terms of the payment coming in June, that's really problematic for us as that's obviously three months of payment where we need to find the money for that.""

Meanwhile the Department of Health said revising its reporting approach for coronavirus deaths ""to ensure data can be verified and published in a timely, consistent way"".

A statement on Twitter said: ""Figures issued today are recorded as of 5pm on March 24 to 5pm on March 25.

"We have come to the end of yet another year in the 21st century. You, like many, may believe that the decade ends on December 31, 2019. There are those who believe that the proper ending is December 31, 2020 and that the third decade in the 21st century rightly starts on January 1, 2021, but we will not allow that to detain us here. What we know for sure is that 2019 has ended.

What we can say with great certainty and clarity is that the first two decades of this century have been as momentous as they have been tragic; as hopeful as they have been filled with despair for countless millions of people; as filled with opportunities for humankind as they have registered disappointments and missed expectations for many.

Around the world 2019 was a year of political ferment. The British have had to face an election to end the wearying issue of Brexit. With the results of the last election favouring the Brexiters, there is greater confidence that Britain will leave the European Union, but with no clear prognosis of what the future holds.

The Middle East, home of the birth of the three major religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam — continued to be a cauldron of hate and dislocation for millions of people. I have become convinced that there would be better prospects for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians if they were left to work out their difficulties without interference from external parties such as America and Russia. But that is a subject for deeper analysis.

Fires have burned in Chile, France, Bolivia, Venezuela, and other parts of the world as people register their protests against the excesses of their leaders, or as they rail against corruption in their societies. The evil forces of hatred, bigotry, and racism werre evident in parts of the world. The incivility in social discourse, spurred on by the Internet, continued apace.

Americans, for the third time, have impeached a sitting president with all that this implies for peace and stability in the country. That nation's major institutions — the presidency, the Congress, intelligence agencies, and judiciary — have been severely tested by the intemperance and immorality of a president who lives by his own rules and who demonstrates proclivities of governance that would make Genghis Khan look like a good Sunday school teacher. In a year when the economy appears to be humming, the growing income inequality in that country has ensured that close to 60 per cent of Americans cannot find uS$400 to pay a bill without going into debt. Something is wrong with this glaring contradiction in the American economy. What hope is there that this problem will be redressed in 2020, a presidential election year, at a time when the country has never been more divided?

Here in Jamaica we have managed to kill close to 450 of our fellow citizens in wreckages on the roads. In what seems to have now become gruesomely normative, we have murdered over 1,300 of our fellow citizens mainly by the gun. In fact, we have averaged over 1,000 murders in Jamaica over the past 20 years. A small country with such violent crime statistics cannot escape the inevitable shredding of its social fabric with all the negative psychological consequences attached.

Yet, despite these frightening statistics and the growing gap between the rich and the poor, it would be foolish to write a political, social, or economic obituary for the country. The inconvenient and uncomfortable truth is that crime is where it is because, collectively, as a nation, we have allowed it to be so. Strong resolve on our part as citizens can hold our political representatives accountable in putting resources and sound thinking to the issue. It is not beyond us to contain the murderous few who derive pleasure from slaughtering others.

We must not just sit on our verandahs or in our rum bars and jabber about corruption. We must become actively engaged in a movement to ferret out the corrupt among us — who, incidentally, are not just politicians) — and to insist on workable mechanisms of accountability to arrest the problem.

As we enter a new year — and for some a new decade — the challenges will be no less than what we faced in the preceding ones. In fact, they might have become more urgent. But we are a resilient people and the country can sail to new horizons of achievement if we bend our collective will to the task. What we do know is that problems do not end because a new year starts. But a new year presents opportunities to look at old problems through, perhaps, better, and less jaded lenses.

In keeping with the Socratic philosophy of the unexamined life not worth the living, personal resolutions will be made for self-improvement and relational enhancement among others. We must examine carefully what we resolve to do or not to do in the new year. What I know of resolutions that people make at the beginning of a year is that they tend to remain largely unfulfilled at the end of the year. For some people, their resolve begins to buckle or fade by March. A large part of the problem is that goals we set were never attainable in the first place. There was no strength of will attached to achieving them. Perhaps they were too audacious in the first place. Jim Collins and Jerry I Porras, in their still important book on business, Built to Last, coined the phrase “big, hairy, audacious goal” (BHAG) which encourages companies and individuals to aim high and to stretch their imagination in achieving success. All of this is good, but any goal we set must be tempered with reality and a heavy dose of common sense.

So, I would advise what I do for myself. Yes, keep your resolutions big, hairy and audacious, but don't get ahead of yourself. I would urge simple, manageable, incremental steps towards one goal. Focus on what you intend to achieve like a laser beam and avoid toxicity in your personal space by not being in the company of the scornful and the envious. You can never achieve your goals by approaching life with the same habits, mindset, and attitudes that hobbled you in the preceding year. Change will not happen unless you manage it in small, incremental, manageable steps.

A truly productive and healthy new year to you.

As a news organization, it’s AIN’s job to stick to reporting on what has already happened. One exception is this time, every year. In the following segments, you’ll read what we believe to be the outlook for key elements of our industry for the next 12 months—views inevitably shaped by the past, but with an eye toward what we believe is just beyond the immediate horizon.

You’ll get our take on the immediate future of eVTOL, not the lofty aspirations of the over-optimistic, but the cold reality; the bubbling cauldron of election-year politics as it impacts our industry; 2020’s outlook for what’s in line for the FBO industry; what’s on tap for OEMs in an ever-volatile market; avionics in the wake of the ADS-B (soft?) deadline; and what you can expect to see on the shop floors—and in the order books—of MROs.

So, how did we do last year? Here are some samples of what we were projecting for 2019:

eVTOL: “Even if eVTOLs win public acceptance and clear regulatory and technological hurdles, can OEMs and service providers deliver the technology at a price the general public can afford?” That remains the biggest open question in aviation.



Touchscreens: “It won’t be a surprise to see more manufacturers adopting this technology, especially as younger tech-savvy pilots move up the flying food chain to more sophisticated aircraft.” Twelve months later, that seems on track.

Supersonics: “Through 2019, Aerion and its partners will be initiating the process of selecting Tier 1 suppliers for the next phase of development.” This predated the February 2019 announcement of Boeing’s investment and involvement in the AS2 project. Since then, the program has gone largely silent.

The family of a man who was stabbed to death in Derby bravely listened to his last moments as a harrowing 999 call was played in court.

The son and daughter of Simon Jones heard how former armed forces member John King tried in vain to save their dad by performing CPR on him on the driveway where had collapsed.

Moments earlier the 57-year-old had been stabbed three times to the legs in a car park. He managed to stagger to Mr King’s front door before banging on it and then collapsing.

A haunting 999 call to the emergency services heard Mr King’s son – Dean King – talk the call handler through what his father was doing to try and keep Mr Jones, himself a former RAF man, alive.

Three men are on trial at Derby Crown Court after being charged with murder and conspiracy to rob.

Kirk Guy, John Williams and Jacob Ali, all of Chaddesden, deny the charges.

The harrowing 999 call

In the call, Dean King tells the operator: “Someone keeps banging on the door saying ‘help me, help me’.

“I don’t know what to do.”

The operator replies: “Can you see anybody?”

Mr King says: “I am talking to the person that’s with him he says he’s been stabbed, there’s a lot of blood, he’s not conscious, I don’t think he’s breathing.

“My dad is going to perform CPR, he’s been in the armed forces and knows how to do CPR.”

The operator asks: “Can his (Mr Jones’) friend (Mr Calladine) help?”

Mr King replies: “He is too traumatised, he’s running around in the road.”

The operator says: “I have officers travelling to you.”

Mr King says: “He’s (Mr Jones) started breathing, my dad can’t see a wound, he’s trying to find a wound now.

“He (Mr Jones) keeps gasping for air.

“There’s movement but it’s very weak.”

The operator asks: “Where is his friend (Mr Calladine) now?”

Mr King replies: “He’s run off towards the park I think.

“There’s lots of blood, it’s dripping all down the driveway.

“My dad says he’s breathing but it’s very weak.”

Moments later the emergence services arrive and take over trying unsuccessfully to save Mr Jones’ life.

Elsewhere during today's proceedings, the jury was told that Williams - the man who is alleged to have physically stabbed Mr Jones - later sent damning messages over Facebook which “are akin to a confession” that he was responsible for the death.

In them, the 24-year-old thanks his girlfriend for sticking with him and tells her she is “not going to have him around for a long time”.

And in a message to his step-brother, he asks his sibling to look after his young son and “teach him how to be a man”.

Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said after the stabbing of Mr Jones, at around 9.45pm on April 20 last year, Williams moved to a friend’s address in Belper to “lie low”.

Facebook messages

He said: “In a Facebook message that is clearly from Williams to his girlfriend, he says ‘my baby girl I am sorry for everything. I did not mean to put you through all this and (after) everything I have done you still stick by me. I am sorry you are not going to have me around for a long time’.""

Mr Joyce continued: ""Why is he saying that? We say it is because he knows exactly what he has done and that he is not going to be around in her life.

“It is akin to a confession to his girlfriend.”

Mr Joyce said four minutes after sending that message, Williams then sent a Facebook message to his step-brother.

He said: “In it he says ‘My brother make sure you look after JJ [his baby son]’. He then says to him ‘teach him how to be a man, love you bro’.

“This is a very, very, small child. He then instructs him (his step-brother) at the end to ‘delete all these messages’.”

The trial has already heard how Mr Jones travelled to the car park with Mr Calladine to carry out a drug deal on the evening of April 20, 2019.

Mr Calladine, who worked for Mr Jones’ bailiff company, had allegedly set the exchange up with Guy two days earlier while the pair were at the Atlanta Gym, in Dunton Close, Derby.

The court heard the deal involved “several thousands of pounds of cocaine”.

But the prosecution claim Guy arranged for Williams and Ali to rob them of the drugs instead.

Chaddesden Park

Opening the case on Thursday, Mr Joyce said Calladine was robbed at knifepoint and ran away so Williams approached Mr Jones who was in the passenger seat of his VW Transporter gang and stabbed him.

Mr Jones, having suffered fatal stab wounds to his legs, managed to stagger out of the car park leaving a trail of blood and to the front door of the King family in nearby Chaddesden Lane.

The occupants rang 999 and tried in vain to save the victim who was pronounced dead just over an hour later at the Royal Derby Hospital.

Mr Joyce told the hearing that in the aftermath of the stabbing the knife was taken back to Ali’s address, in Chaddesden, where is was cleaned using bleach in a mop bucket.

He said it was then wrapped and transported to an address in Alvaston where it was later discovered concealed in a water tank and recovered by police.

The mobile phone stolen from Mr Calladine was found in shrubbery in Kiwi Park, also in Alvaston.

Mr Joyce said: “The prosecution case is that it was Williams that actually stabbed Simon Jones and that the others, Guy and Ali, either intended to assist him or intended to both rob him and cause him really serious injury or to kill him in the course of the robbery.

“Guy set it up, Ali drove Williams to the scene and Williams was the killer.

“It does not matter for the purposes of this case whether the drugs were taken in the VW Transporter van to Chaddesden Park belonged to Carl Calladine or Simon Jones.

“What matters is that Guy, Ali and Williams knew the cocaine would be there and intended to steal it.

“There was no indication (in arranging the drug deal) that Mr Jones would even be there that night.

“But when Mr Calladine runs away Mr Williams goes to the van and sadly, so sadly, there was someone else there and that’s Simon Jones.

“And for being there, Simon Jones pays with his life.”

Members of Mr Jones family as well as supporters of Guy, 34, of Haydn Road, Williams, 24, of Waterford Drive, and Ali, 20, of Ashworth Avenue, all in Chaddesden, were all in court to hear the case opened.

His family have previously described him as “a true gentleman who was adored by everyone”.

The trial, which is scheduled to last up to six weeks, continues.","New Delhi: The Supreme Court will on Friday (February 7) hear Centre's appeal challenging the Delhi High Court verdict dismissing its plea against stay on the execution of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case. The matter will come up for hearing before the 3-judge bench, comprising Justices R Bhanumathi, Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna, around 12.30 PM.

On behalf of the Centre, Additional Solicitor General KM Natraj had moved the top court seeking an urgent hearing on its appeal challenging the Delhi High Court verdict which held on Wednesday that the Nirbhaya death row convicts have to be executed together and not separately.

The Centre told the top court that Tihar Jail authorities are unable to execute the convicts in the case despite the fact that their review petitions have been dismissed and curative petitions and mercy pleas of three of them have been rejected.

The high court had set a week's deadline for them to avail the remaining remedies. If the convicts choose not to make any type of petition in seven days from now, the institutions/ authorities concerned will deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay, it said.

Live TV

Meanwhile, a trial court on Thursday sought the response of the four convicts on the plea of Tihar jail authorities seeking issuance of fresh death warrants against them.

The trial court had on January 31 stayed ""till further orders"" execution of the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.

Later, the Centre moved the High Court against the stay of the execution of the convicts. Hours after the high court's verdict, the Centre filed an appeal against it in the apex court.

"Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a £9 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to £2,500 a month to help them cope with the effects of coronavirus.

The Chancellor tonight said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, will cover 80 per cent of a self-employed person's average monthly profits.

But it may not be available until June and will only be available to those who have a tax return for 2019, meaning the newly self-employed will be ineligible.

And Mr Sunak warned that the self-employed could face tax hikes in the future as part of the effort to ""right the ship"" and repair the battered public finances after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Details of the scheme came as the Department of Health announced a total of 578 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK have died as of 5pm on March 25.

Some 11,658 people have tested positive in the UK as of 9am on March 26.

Mr Sunak's scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”",0.876292

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”","The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.87735116

"Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a £9 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to £2,500 a month to help them cope with the effects of coronavirus.

The Chancellor tonight said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, will cover 80 per cent of a self-employed person's average monthly profits.

But it may not be available until June and will only be available to those who have a tax return for 2019, meaning the newly self-employed will be ineligible.

And Mr Sunak warned that the self-employed could face tax hikes in the future as part of the effort to ""right the ship"" and repair the battered public finances after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Details of the scheme came as the Department of Health announced a total of 578 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK have died as of 5pm on March 25.

Some 11,658 people have tested positive in the UK as of 9am on March 26.

Mr Sunak's scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

To qualify, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.

Up to 3.8 million people will qualify for support, with average monthly payments expected to be £940 per person.

Mr Sunak said the scheme, which will last for at least three months, ""is one of the most generous in the world"".

""It targets support to those who need help most, offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work.""

He said the measure covers 95 per cent of people who receive the majority of their income from self-employment.

But in a hint that the self-employed could be asked to pay more to the taxman in future he said it was ""now much harder to justify"" the tax breaks on offer to the self-employed if they were receiving the same level of state support.

He said everyone would be ""chipping in together to right the ship afterwards"" once the crisis is over.

A number of self-employed workers welcomed the Chancellor's measures but expressed concern about having to wait until June to claim.

Louise Barina, a production manager who lives in London, said: ""After having spoken to our landlord, he has outright said no, that we can't get a delay on our rent.

""In terms of the payment coming in June, that's really problematic for us as that's obviously three months of payment where we need to find the money for that.""

Meanwhile the Department of Health said revising its reporting approach for coronavirus deaths ""to ensure data can be verified and published in a timely, consistent way"".

A statement on Twitter said: ""Figures issued today are recorded as of 5pm on March 24 to 5pm on March 25.

""Going forwards, figures on deaths will be recorded for the 24-hour period as of 5pm the previous day. Figures on tests remain as of the 24-hour period from 9am that day.""","Another positive case of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been reported in Mason County.

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

"CLARK COUNTY, Ohio -- Health officials have identified 20 cases of COVID-19 linked to a Dole Fresh Vegetables packing plant in Clark County, Ohio.



Of the 20 cases, 12 are Dole employees (10 confirmed and two probable); eight are contacts of employees (five confirmed and three probable); and three cases involve people who do not live in Clark County, according to a statement released by the Clark County Combined Health District Tuesday, May 19.







The health district on Monday announced it was monitoring the first workplace outbreak in Clark County, and Tuesday, officials identified Dole as the company, according to the Springfield News-Sun.



In a statement to local news station WDTN, Dole maintained that the company has been in constant contact with the packing location since the potential outbreak was initially reported back in April:



“In addition to implementing all public health recommended precautions—social distancing, extensive hand washing, wearing of face masks at all times in our facilities, mandated self-quarantining of employees and contractors exposed to COVID-positive individuals, and increased frequency of deep cleaning and sanitation at the facility, especially in high touch areas—Dole has additionally welcomed CCCHD to come into and inspect the Springfield Salad Facility. Following the inspection, during which CCCHD noted the many protective procedures implemented by Dole, the facility implemented additional protocols based on their suggestions to further increase the safety of our employees and contractors. These include greater distancing and separation of workers in our facility, table dividers installed in our cafeteria and similar dividers in our packing room for added protection.""



Despite implementing additional safety measures, 10 Dole salad plant employees and contractors at the Ohio packing plant tested positive for COVID-19, according to the statement.



“We cannot state with certainty how the transmission occurred, but these results lead us to believe that the plant is not the source of transmission. No matter how the transmission occurred, however, Dole will continue to place employee health and well-being above all else in our efforts to keep fresh salads on shelves across the nation,“ the statement concluded.","Another positive case of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been reported in Mason County. A man in his 70s became the 18th County resident to test positive. Mason County Public Health was notified of the latest positive test on Wednesday, April 9, 2020. Mason County Public Health is conducting contact interviews at this time. The patient is currently isolating at home.

Case information for the 18 positive cases is as follows:

Only one patient has been hospitalized outside Mason County. The remaining patients are isolating at home.

So far, 502 people have been tested in Mason County.

Due to Mason County being a small community, location data of positive cases will not be released to reduce the possibility of patient identification and to protect personal health information. Identified positive cases are located throughout Mason County. To avoid exposure, continue to follow the guidance of washing hands frequently, stay home, unless essential to work and limit travel to only medical appointments, medication pick up, and once every two-week grocery shopping needs. This will help limit your exposure possibilities. Mason County Public Health is asking that the public do their part to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.",0.90569633
