BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

""We would like to thank everyone involved in bringing so many memorable moments to BBC One"".",assad says syria will comply with un arms resolution,0.6443213

Lorraine viewers couldn't believe who they were seeing on their screens today as pop beauty Louise Redknapp came on the show to discuss her new UK tour.

Louise, 45, sent viewers wild as she donned a plunging denim shirt and matching jeans, as they couldn't believe her ageless beauty.

As Louise talked about splitting from ex Jamie Redknapp back in 2017, they rushed to social media to talk about how different she looked.

One fan posted: ""There's a very different looking Louise...wish her all the best for the album.""

Another added: ""Louise looks so different now!""

Louise confessed that splitting Jamie was the hardest thing she had ever done, as she told Lorraine: ""It is the toughest thing anyone will go through, it really was for me.

""Everyday is a new challenge, it was really hard.

""The boys are our priority and we are working together to put them first.""

She also spoke about her former Strictly Come Dancing partner Kevin Clifton announcing he had left the show, sharing her shock with Lorraine.

Discussing her time on the show, Louise admitted: ""It made me fall back in love again with dancing.

“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”

Users of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.

Charity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

That they are contributing to PPGF

The timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF

The implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

Additionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

States and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

pro-russia rebels downed malaysian plane : ukraine,"COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.

“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”

Users of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.

Charity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

That they are contributing to PPGF

The timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF

The implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

Additionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

States and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

boeing stock tumbles after fire on 787 dreamliner,"COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.

“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”

Users of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.

Charity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

That they are contributing to PPGF

The timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF

The implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

Additionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

States and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

""We would like to thank everyone involved in bringing so many memorable moments to BBC One"".","COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.

“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”

Users of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.

Charity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

That they are contributing to PPGF

The timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF

The implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

zoo worker dies after tiger attack,"COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.

“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”

Users of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.

Charity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

That they are contributing to PPGF

The timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF

The implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

Additionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

States and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

""We would like to thank everyone involved in bringing so many memorable moments to BBC One"".",0.6788131

north korea test fires 30 missiles into the sea,"COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.

“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”

Users of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.

Charity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

That they are contributing to PPGF

The timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF

The implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

Additionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

States and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

The hosts actually do a lot of stuff during filming that viewers don't get to see, like provide moral support to the contestants. We started to see more of this with Sandi and Noel but almost never with Mel and Sue because one of them would start cursing to the camera while the other talked the contestant off a cliff (the BBC couldn't air any of this footage because of the cursing).



I'll admit that sometimes the hosts' jokes are bad but GBBO would be missing something without its hosts.

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

"HUGELY popular viral video app Vine is back as 'Byte' – four years after being unexpectedly killed off.

Byte is hoping to regain the popularity of Vine, which was loved for its rule of only allowing 6-second looping videos.

3 Byte is a new app designed to replace the void left by Vine Credit: Byte

The mind behind Byte is Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, who has been working on the new app for two years.

Just like Vine, Byte limits videos to six seconds in length – and loops them after they've finished.

""Today we're bringing back 6-second looping videos and a new community for people who love them,"" Byte's creators wrote.

""It's called Byte and it's both familiar and new. We hope it'll resonate with people who feel something's been missing.""

3 Users will be limited to uploading videos no longer than six seconds – which will loop after finishing Credit: Byte

It was originally supposed to launch in spring 2019, but was delayed for unknown reasons.

Now the app is free to download and is available on iPhone and Android phones.

Vine was founded back in June 2012, and was bought up by Twitter in October that same year – in what's believed to have been a $30million (£22.9million) deal.

The app shot to popularity due to its short clips, with successful users often focusing particularly on comedy videos.

It was free to download, and was available on phones, computers and even game consoles.

But on October 27, 2016, Twitter announced that the Vine mobile app would be discontinued.

In December 2016, it was confirmed that the Vine app would remain operational, but videos would be published directly to Twitter.

A month later, Vine's community website was shut down and the app was renamed to Vine Camera – which was largely deemed a flop.

3 Byte was created by Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman Credit: Twitter

In January 2017, Twitter launched an archive of all Vine videos, but there was no way to upload new content to the service.

Many Vine videos still prove popular on YouTube today, and there's been significant interest in a reboot of the app.

But Vine now faces stiff competition from rival app TikTok, a video app that's hugely popular with teens.

Byte – will it be the next hit app? Here's what industry expert Paolo Pescatore, of PP Foresight, told The Sun... ""Video is the next battle ground and is fast becoming a crowded place with too many services chasing few dollars.

""There are some opportunities to be novel that will resonate with viewers.

""Everyone wants to jump on the new thing but making money and attracting top quality content will represent the biggest test.

""For now new services need to have eyeballs and content.""

Former Vine celebrities who have since transferred to TikTok are already turning up on Byte too.

They include Lance Stewart, Chris Melberger and Josh Darnit.

These online stars are likely attracted by the fact that Byte has vowed to start paying creators immediately – despite having only just launched.

The hosts actually do a lot of stuff during filming that viewers don't get to see, like provide moral support to the contestants. We started to see more of this with Sandi and Noel but almost never with Mel and Sue because one of them would start cursing to the camera while the other talked the contestant off a cliff (the BBC couldn't air any of this footage because of the cursing).

The monkey is brushing the dog,"COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.

“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”

Users of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.

Charity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

That they are contributing to PPGF

The timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF

The implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

Additionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

States and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

Lorraine viewers couldn't believe who they were seeing on their screens today as pop beauty Louise Redknapp came on the show to discuss her new UK tour.

Louise, 45, sent viewers wild as she donned a plunging denim shirt and matching jeans, as they couldn't believe her ageless beauty.

As Louise talked about splitting from ex Jamie Redknapp back in 2017, they rushed to social media to talk about how different she looked.

One fan posted: ""There's a very different looking Louise...wish her all the best for the album.""

Another added: ""Louise looks so different now!""

(Image: ITV)

A third chipped in: ""Wow, barely recognised Louise on Lorraine.""

A fourth wrote: ""Louise is looking more and more like Carol Vorderman everyday.""

Louise confessed that splitting Jamie was the hardest thing she had ever done, as she told Lorraine: ""It is the toughest thing anyone will go through, it really was for me.

""Everyday is a new challenge, it was really hard.

(Image: ITV)

""The boys are our priority and we are working together to put them first.""

She also spoke about her former Strictly Come Dancing partner Kevin Clifton announcing he had left the show, sharing her shock with Lorraine.

Discussing her time on the show, Louise admitted: ""It made me fall back in love again with dancing.

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

Lorraine viewers couldn't believe who they were seeing on their screens today as pop beauty Louise Redknapp came on the show to discuss her new UK tour.

Louise, 45, sent viewers wild as she donned a plunging denim shirt and matching jeans, as they couldn't believe her ageless beauty.

As Louise talked about splitting from ex Jamie Redknapp back in 2017, they rushed to social media to talk about how different she looked.

One fan posted: ""There's a very different looking Louise...wish her all the best for the album.""

Another added: ""Louise looks so different now!""

(Image: ITV)

A third chipped in: ""Wow, barely recognised Louise on Lorraine.""

A fourth wrote: ""Louise is looking more and more like Carol Vorderman everyday.""

Louise confessed that splitting Jamie was the hardest thing she had ever done, as she told Lorraine: ""It is the toughest thing anyone will go through, it really was for me.

""Everyday is a new challenge, it was really hard.

(Image: ITV)

""The boys are our priority and we are working together to put them first.""

She also spoke about her former Strictly Come Dancing partner Kevin Clifton announcing he had left the show, sharing her shock with Lorraine.

Discussing her time on the show, Louise admitted: ""It made me fall back in love again with dancing.

""That was when I thought there is a bit of life left in me.""

Louise and Kevin starred in the 2016 series of the show, narrowly missing out on the Glitterball to presenter Ore Oduba.

She announced her split from Jamie, who she married in 1998, as she announced the end of their 19 year marriage.

PPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

( Middle East Monitor ) – If any country which claims to be a democracy, its potential prime minister declares that the votes of a significant minority are not part of the democratic ‘equation’, they would be rightly condemned as racists. That is exactly what Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu declared when claiming he had won the recent Israeli elections when he said that he won among the”Zionist” voters because “Arabs are not part of the equation.” Let that sink in. The reason Palestinian citizens of Israel are a minority is only because during its creation, 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homeland through Zionist terror.

By ‘Zionist’ Netanyahu refers to Jews, an equivalence we are told should not be made because it is used by some to hide their anti-Jewish sentiments. At a stroke, Netanyahu delegitimised the votes of 300,000 of Israel’s own citizens because they are not Jewish and would not vote for him.

Netanyahu has form when it comes to racism against non-Jewish citizens from his country. In an election day video in 2015 he urged his supporters to go out and vote because “the rule of the right is in danger, Arab voters are coming in droves to the ballot boxes,” Netanyahu declared in the video. “Left-wing NGOs are bringing them in buses.”

However, in quite a hypocritical U-turn after winning the election, Netanyahu decided to reach out to the Palestinian citizens of Israel offering a half-hearted apology. He said “I know the things I said several days ago offended some of Israel’s citizens, hurt the Arab citizens,” Netanyahu told invited representatives of the Arab community at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. “This was never my intent. I apologize for this.”

This was rejected by Joint List leader Ayman Odeh who called the apology a duplicitous “flip-flop.” So long as Netanyahu “advances racist legislation… and does not promote real equality” for Israel’s Arabs, said the MK, the prime minister’s apology would not be acceptable or credible.

Both episodes in 2015 and recently show the racism that is at the core of Netanyahu’s and the right-wing coalition ideology. Palestinian citizens of Israel are at best second class citizens. In 2018, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman on accused the leader of the Joint (Arab) List MK, Ayman Odeh, and his associates of being a “fifth column” and said they should be “outlawed” for their support of a Gaza solidarity protest in Haifa. Lieberman lamented the “systematic failure” of law enforcement to take action against Odeh “and his friends” and called for them to be “outlawed.”

READ: BDS Movement marks demise of Israel’s culinary propaganda initiative

Current Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennet has also revelled in his racism against Palestinians, claiming in 2013, “I’ve killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there’s no problem with that.” In 2017 as Education Minister, he told MKs of Palestinian origin to choose to be either ‘normal Israelis’ or ‘terrorists’. Bennett also believes that Palestinians ‘already have their state in Jordan’.

Blue and White (Kahol Lavan) leader Benny Gantz would not contemplate forming a government with the Joint Arab List claiming he is not “afraid to speak to any legitimate political party, but the Joint List will not be part of the government I form.” He said, “my disagreements with its leadership on the national and security issues are deep, difficult and unbridgeable,”. He continued, “I intend to implement President Trump’s peace plan, in coordination with all the elements in the region, and see it as a significant milestone.” Israel “cannot tolerate support for terrorism or avoid condemnation,” Gantz said.

Gantz did not object to the inclusion in Trump’s plan a provision to strip 300,000 Palestinian Israeli citizens of their citizenship in ‘land swaps’, that would see the area known as the ‘Triangle’ become part of the so called Palestinian state, without asking that population for it’s views.

None of the above discrimination and shear racism against Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel should surprise us. Israel has over sixty laws that discriminate against its Palestinian citizens and Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. And most were implemented before Israel’s main political leadership either drafted or supported in the Knesset in 2018 the ‘Nation State Law’ or as I called it Israel’s “Jewish State Apartheid Law” when it was passed. At its core is the premise that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, whatever Israel’s borders are. In Trump’s plan it is clear that Israel ‘security border is the whole of historic Palestine, from the river Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.

The question of whether Israel is an Apartheid state was settled in the ESCWA report, which was commissioned to assess in an academic manner by eminent academics Richard Falk and Virginia Tilley. They concluded in the peer reviewed report that Israel exercised Apartheid against the Palestinian people as a whole. And before the usual suspects rubbish the report’s status because ESCWA was asked to take it down from its website, let me assure them about its status.

READ: Palestinian boycott movement slams Austrian parliament anti-BDS motion

I asked former Under-Secretary-General Dr Rima Khalaf who resigned rather than take it down, she assured me that it is still an official UN report. Therefore, its conclusions stand. Israel is an Apartheid state, which should be isolated and shunned until its racist regime is dismantled, leading either to two independent, sovereign states, an Israeli and Palestinian state, or a single democratic state for all those it rules over between the river and the sea.

Israel cannot for ever continue to rule over half the people whose lives it controls on a daily basis, without giving them their legitimate rights and claim to be a democracy. Judging by the violent past 72 years since its creation, it will not have peace until it either separates Jews from others or accepts that all human beings are entitled to be treated equally and accept it cannot be Jewish and Democratic.

And here it cannot claim the problem is with the Palestinians who will not lie down and surrender. Neither can its backers in the West.

It is the same Western governments which sided with the oppressive Apartheid regime in South Africa that are siding with and protecting the Apartheid regime in Israel. Instead of sanctioning it for its crimes, the West bolsters trade with Israel and simply condemns its criminal actions as an illegal occupier who is commits war crimes almost on a daily basis at least in terms of its settlement enterprise. And when the Palestinians seek redress through peaceful, legal means and take the settlement file to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israel’s backers the US, Germany and Canada ask it not do so by claiming it does not have jurisdiction over Palestine because it is not a state.

When the Palestinians call for peaceful Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), the US and France pass anti-BDS laws and France equates BDS to anti-Semitism. The UK has tried to ban pension funds from divestment from companies complicit in Israel’s crimes and the Conservative Government only had Israel in mind when announcing it would legislate against boycotts by public bodies in its manifesto. It has also committed to forcing public bodies, including universities to adopt the flawed IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism, which has more to do with shielding Israel from criticism than it does protecting British Jews from real anti-Semitism. That is also the reason why Israel’s advocates have tried and failed to cancel Israel Apartheid Week on campuses across the world.

It seems the so-called international community is sending not mixed but rather clear signals to the Palestinians. They stand with Israeli Apartheid and against Palestinian rights. This is hypocrisy on heat.

"HUGELY popular viral video app Vine is back as 'Byte' – four years after being unexpectedly killed off.

Byte is hoping to regain the popularity of Vine, which was loved for its rule of only allowing 6-second looping videos.

3 Byte is a new app designed to replace the void left by Vine Credit: Byte

The mind behind Byte is Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, who has been working on the new app for two years.

Just like Vine, Byte limits videos to six seconds in length – and loops them after they've finished.

""Today we're bringing back 6-second looping videos and a new community for people who love them,"" Byte's creators wrote.

""It's called Byte and it's both familiar and new. We hope it'll resonate with people who feel something's been missing.""

3 Users will be limited to uploading videos no longer than six seconds – which will loop after finishing Credit: Byte

It was originally supposed to launch in spring 2019, but was delayed for unknown reasons.

Now the app is free to download and is available on iPhone and Android phones.

Vine was founded back in June 2012, and was bought up by Twitter in October that same year – in what's believed to have been a $30million (£22.9million) deal.

The app shot to popularity due to its short clips, with successful users often focusing particularly on comedy videos.

It was free to download, and was available on phones, computers and even game consoles.

But on October 27, 2016, Twitter announced that the Vine mobile app would be discontinued.

In December 2016, it was confirmed that the Vine app would remain operational, but videos would be published directly to Twitter.

A month later, Vine's community website was shut down and the app was renamed to Vine Camera – which was largely deemed a flop.

3 Byte was created by Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman Credit: Twitter

In January 2017, Twitter launched an archive of all Vine videos, but there was no way to upload new content to the service.

Many Vine videos still prove popular on YouTube today, and there's been significant interest in a reboot of the app.

But Vine now faces stiff competition from rival app TikTok, a video app that's hugely popular with teens.

Byte – will it be the next hit app? Here's what industry expert Paolo Pescatore, of PP Foresight, told The Sun... ""Video is the next battle ground and is fast becoming a crowded place with too many services chasing few dollars.

""There are some opportunities to be novel that will resonate with viewers.

""Everyone wants to jump on the new thing but making money and attracting top quality content will represent the biggest test.

""For now new services need to have eyeballs and content.""

Former Vine celebrities who have since transferred to TikTok are already turning up on Byte too.

They include Lance Stewart, Chris Melberger and Josh Darnit.

These online stars are likely attracted by the fact that Byte has vowed to start paying creators immediately – despite having only just launched.

The hosts actually do a lot of stuff during filming that viewers don't get to see, like provide moral support to the contestants. We started to see more of this with Sandi and Noel but almost never with Mel and Sue because one of them would start cursing to the camera while the other talked the contestant off a cliff (the BBC couldn't air any of this footage because of the cursing).



I'll admit that sometimes the hosts' jokes are bad but GBBO would be missing something without its hosts.

bulbs a and b are still connected to the closed circuit containing the battery,"COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.

Lorraine viewers couldn't believe who they were seeing on their screens today as pop beauty Louise Redknapp came on the show to discuss her new UK tour.

Louise, 45, sent viewers wild as she donned a plunging denim shirt and matching jeans, as they couldn't believe her ageless beauty.

As Louise talked about splitting from ex Jamie Redknapp back in 2017, they rushed to social media to talk about how different she looked.

One fan posted: ""There's a very different looking Louise...wish her all the best for the album.""

Another added: ""Louise looks so different now!""

(Image: ITV)

A third chipped in: ""Wow, barely recognised Louise on Lorraine.""

A fourth wrote: ""Louise is looking more and more like Carol Vorderman everyday.""

Louise confessed that splitting Jamie was the hardest thing she had ever done, as she told Lorraine: ""It is the toughest thing anyone will go through, it really was for me.

""Everyday is a new challenge, it was really hard.

(Image: ITV)

""The boys are our priority and we are working together to put them first.""

She also spoke about her former Strictly Come Dancing partner Kevin Clifton announcing he had left the show, sharing her shock with Lorraine.

Discussing her time on the show, Louise admitted: ""It made me fall back in love again with dancing.

""That was when I thought there is a bit of life left in me.""

Louise and Kevin starred in the 2016 series of the show, narrowly missing out on the Glitterball to presenter Ore Oduba.

She announced her split from Jamie, who she married in 1998, as she announced the end of their 19 year marriage.

"HUGELY popular viral video app Vine is back as 'Byte' – four years after being unexpectedly killed off.

Byte is hoping to regain the popularity of Vine, which was loved for its rule of only allowing 6-second looping videos.

3 Byte is a new app designed to replace the void left by Vine Credit: Byte

The mind behind Byte is Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, who has been working on the new app for two years.

Just like Vine, Byte limits videos to six seconds in length – and loops them after they've finished.

""Today we're bringing back 6-second looping videos and a new community for people who love them,"" Byte's creators wrote.

""It's called Byte and it's both familiar and new. We hope it'll resonate with people who feel something's been missing.""

3 Users will be limited to uploading videos no longer than six seconds – which will loop after finishing Credit: Byte

It was originally supposed to launch in spring 2019, but was delayed for unknown reasons.

Now the app is free to download and is available on iPhone and Android phones.

Vine was founded back in June 2012, and was bought up by Twitter in October that same year – in what's believed to have been a $30million (£22.9million) deal.

The app shot to popularity due to its short clips, with successful users often focusing particularly on comedy videos.

It was free to download, and was available on phones, computers and even game consoles.

But on October 27, 2016, Twitter announced that the Vine mobile app would be discontinued.

In December 2016, it was confirmed that the Vine app would remain operational, but videos would be published directly to Twitter.

A month later, Vine's community website was shut down and the app was renamed to Vine Camera – which was largely deemed a flop.

3 Byte was created by Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman Credit: Twitter

In January 2017, Twitter launched an archive of all Vine videos, but there was no way to upload new content to the service.

Many Vine videos still prove popular on YouTube today, and there's been significant interest in a reboot of the app.

But Vine now faces stiff competition from rival app TikTok, a video app that's hugely popular with teens.

Byte – will it be the next hit app? Here's what industry expert Paolo Pescatore, of PP Foresight, told The Sun... ""Video is the next battle ground and is fast becoming a crowded place with too many services chasing few dollars.

""There are some opportunities to be novel that will resonate with viewers.

""Everyone wants to jump on the new thing but making money and attracting top quality content will represent the biggest test.

""For now new services need to have eyeballs and content.""

Former Vine celebrities who have since transferred to TikTok are already turning up on Byte too.

They include Lance Stewart, Chris Melberger and Josh Darnit.

These online stars are likely attracted by the fact that Byte has vowed to start paying creators immediately – despite having only just launched.

Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase

After reaching highs of over ₹200 per kg, the price of onions is now seeing a steep crash with the new crop harvested over the last two weeks flooding the market. This has resulted in a glut of onions, say traders.

A kilo of onions, even of the best quality, is now trading at the ₹35 — ₹40 levels in the wholesale market, leaving many farmers who hoped to cash in on the shortage unhappy. They are retailing around ₹40 — ₹50.

Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase. “The prices will fall below ₹20 by the month-end and may even fall below ₹10 by February-end,” predicted Ravi Kumar of the Bangalore Onions and Potatoes Traders’ Association.

This has left the farmers worried. At present, onions from Vijayapura and Chitradurga districts and the Nasik region of Maharashtra are flooding the wholesale markets in the State.

“The earlier crop suffered massive damage owing to heavy rains. Expecting high prices, farmers — even those who used to grow maize for a second crop — started growing onions,” Mr. Kumar explained. More onions are expected to come from Punjab and Madhya Pradesh by February, even as supply from within Karnataka is also expected to go up. This will further lead to crash in prices, traders predict.

“Though the price of onions shot up recently, we did not make much profit, as the yield was very low. Onions had turned wet and were decomposing in the fields itself. What we could sell was very low. But given the prices were started growing them again, only to see the prices crashing in a free fall. It will be tough to bear these losses,” said Basavaraj, a farmer from Vijayapura.

However, G. Srinivasan, Director, HOPCOMS, remains optimistic and says that the demand for onions will also increase especially as many households had limited or even stopped purchasing the staple ingredient for a while. “There will be a stabilisation of prices, but may not crash,” he said

Coconut farmers sustain losses

Coconut farmers, too, are bearing the brunt of the price crash. The price of a quintal of copra (dry coconut) that was in the range of ₹17,000-₹18,000, a few months ago, was trading at ₹11,500 on Saturday at Tiptur APMC, the prime coconut market in the State. The prices of coconuts have also seen a dip, from over ₹20 per nut to ₹17 per nut over the last few days. However, they are still being sold in the range of ₹25 and ₹30 in the retail market.

Devraj, a coconut farmer from Tiptur, said the present copra and coconut prices will not fetch them the cultivation cost.

“The input costs – diesel, labour and fertilizers – have gone up. The cost of copra should at least be around ₹15,000 per quintal if farmers have to recover the cultivation cost. Presently, we are reeling under losses,” he added.",0.7357193

The hosts actually do a lot of stuff during filming that viewers don't get to see, like provide moral support to the contestants. We started to see more of this with Sandi and Noel but almost never with Mel and Sue because one of them would start cursing to the camera while the other talked the contestant off a cliff (the BBC couldn't air any of this footage because of the cursing).



I'll admit that sometimes the hosts' jokes are bad but GBBO would be missing something without its hosts.

( Middle East Monitor ) – If any country which claims to be a democracy, its potential prime minister declares that the votes of a significant minority are not part of the democratic ‘equation’, they would be rightly condemned as racists. That is exactly what Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu declared when claiming he had won the recent Israeli elections when he said that he won among the”Zionist” voters because “Arabs are not part of the equation.” Let that sink in. The reason Palestinian citizens of Israel are a minority is only because during its creation, 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homeland through Zionist terror.

By ‘Zionist’ Netanyahu refers to Jews, an equivalence we are told should not be made because it is used by some to hide their anti-Jewish sentiments. At a stroke, Netanyahu delegitimised the votes of 300,000 of Israel’s own citizens because they are not Jewish and would not vote for him.

Netanyahu has form when it comes to racism against non-Jewish citizens from his country. In an election day video in 2015 he urged his supporters to go out and vote because “the rule of the right is in danger, Arab voters are coming in droves to the ballot boxes,” Netanyahu declared in the video. “Left-wing NGOs are bringing them in buses.”

However, in quite a hypocritical U-turn after winning the election, Netanyahu decided to reach out to the Palestinian citizens of Israel offering a half-hearted apology. He said “I know the things I said several days ago offended some of Israel’s citizens, hurt the Arab citizens,” Netanyahu told invited representatives of the Arab community at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. “This was never my intent. I apologize for this.”

This was rejected by Joint List leader Ayman Odeh who called the apology a duplicitous “flip-flop.” So long as Netanyahu “advances racist legislation… and does not promote real equality” for Israel’s Arabs, said the MK, the prime minister’s apology would not be acceptable or credible.

Both episodes in 2015 and recently show the racism that is at the core of Netanyahu’s and the right-wing coalition ideology. Palestinian citizens of Israel are at best second class citizens. In 2018, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman on accused the leader of the Joint (Arab) List MK, Ayman Odeh, and his associates of being a “fifth column” and said they should be “outlawed” for their support of a Gaza solidarity protest in Haifa. Lieberman lamented the “systematic failure” of law enforcement to take action against Odeh “and his friends” and called for them to be “outlawed.”

Current Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennet has also revelled in his racism against Palestinians, claiming in 2013, “I’ve killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there’s no problem with that.” In 2017 as Education Minister, he told MKs of Palestinian origin to choose to be either ‘normal Israelis’ or ‘terrorists’. Bennett also believes that Palestinians ‘already have their state in Jordan’.

Blue and White (Kahol Lavan) leader Benny Gantz would not contemplate forming a government with the Joint Arab List claiming he is not “afraid to speak to any legitimate political party, but the Joint List will not be part of the government I form.” He said, “my disagreements with its leadership on the national and security issues are deep, difficult and unbridgeable,”. He continued, “I intend to implement President Trump’s peace plan, in coordination with all the elements in the region, and see it as a significant milestone.” Israel “cannot tolerate support for terrorism or avoid condemnation,” Gantz said.

Gantz did not object to the inclusion in Trump’s plan a provision to strip 300,000 Palestinian Israeli citizens of their citizenship in ‘land swaps’, that would see the area known as the ‘Triangle’ become part of the so called Palestinian state, without asking that population for it’s views.

None of the above discrimination and shear racism against Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel should surprise us. Israel has over sixty laws that discriminate against its Palestinian citizens and Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. And most were implemented before Israel’s main political leadership either drafted or supported in the Knesset in 2018 the ‘Nation State Law’ or as I called it Israel’s “Jewish State Apartheid Law” when it was passed. At its core is the premise that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, whatever Israel’s borders are. In Trump’s plan it is clear that Israel ‘security border is the whole of historic Palestine, from the river Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.

The question of whether Israel is an Apartheid state was settled in the ESCWA report, which was commissioned to assess in an academic manner by eminent academics Richard Falk and Virginia Tilley. They concluded in the peer reviewed report that Israel exercised Apartheid against the Palestinian people as a whole. And before the usual suspects rubbish the report’s status because ESCWA was asked to take it down from its website, let me assure them about its status.

READ: Palestinian boycott movement slams Austrian parliament anti-BDS motion

I asked former Under-Secretary-General Dr Rima Khalaf who resigned rather than take it down, she assured me that it is still an official UN report. Therefore, its conclusions stand. Israel is an Apartheid state, which should be isolated and shunned until its racist regime is dismantled, leading either to two independent, sovereign states, an Israeli and Palestinian state, or a single democratic state for all those it rules over between the river and the sea.

Israel cannot for ever continue to rule over half the people whose lives it controls on a daily basis, without giving them their legitimate rights and claim to be a democracy. Judging by the violent past 72 years since its creation, it will not have peace until it either separates Jews from others or accepts that all human beings are entitled to be treated equally and accept it cannot be Jewish and Democratic.

And here it cannot claim the problem is with the Palestinians who will not lie down and surrender. Neither can its backers in the West.

It is the same Western governments which sided with the oppressive Apartheid regime in South Africa that are siding with and protecting the Apartheid regime in Israel. Instead of sanctioning it for its crimes, the West bolsters trade with Israel and simply condemns its criminal actions as an illegal occupier who is commits war crimes almost on a daily basis at least in terms of its settlement enterprise. And when the Palestinians seek redress through peaceful, legal means and take the settlement file to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israel’s backers the US, Germany and Canada ask it not do so by claiming it does not have jurisdiction over Palestine because it is not a state.

When the Palestinians call for peaceful Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), the US and France pass anti-BDS laws and France equates BDS to anti-Semitism. The UK has tried to ban pension funds from divestment from companies complicit in Israel’s crimes and the Conservative Government only had Israel in mind when announcing it would legislate against boycotts by public bodies in its manifesto. It has also committed to forcing public bodies, including universities to adopt the flawed IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism, which has more to do with shielding Israel from criticism than it does protecting British Jews from real anti-Semitism. That is also the reason why Israel’s advocates have tried and failed to cancel Israel Apartheid Week on campuses across the world.

It seems the so-called international community is sending not mixed but rather clear signals to the Palestinians. They stand with Israeli Apartheid and against Palestinian rights. This is hypocrisy on heat.
