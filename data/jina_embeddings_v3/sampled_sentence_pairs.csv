syrian opposition offers assad truce in homs for duration of ramadan,"Picking the best games of the decade is an increasingly tough task. The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

Blizzard has done a great job at cultivating “Overwatch” as an esport, and with its Overwatch League moving its teams to local markets in 2020 and a sequel on the way, the future looks bright for the game.",0.04595756
"Today, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll look at Hotel Grand Central Limited's (SGX:H18) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Hotel Grand Central has a price to earnings ratio of 38.26, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.6%.

View our latest analysis for Hotel Grand Central

How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Hotel Grand Central:

P/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 ÷ SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Hotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. Although we don't have analyst forecasts you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out this more detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.",libya abruptly closes its borders with four countries,0.04752065

"In news that has absolutely destroyed my brain, OG reality TV star Paris Hilton just revealed she’s been playing a character up until now.

Yes, Hilton has been laughing all the way to the fucking bank because her character on The Simple Life, and just her general persona has all been an act.

I. AM. SCREAMING.

Just days after we all collectively lost our minds over her Cooking With Paris video, the entrepreneur and socialite has revealed that her upcoming YouTube documentary This Is Paris will be the first time we get to see the real deal.

During an interview at the Television Critics Association press tour, Paris revealed that her upcoming YouTube documentary is “completely different than anything [she’s] ever done before.”

“Everything I’ve ever done before was more me playing that character again,” The Simple Life star said. “But with this, I really just wanted to pull the curtain back and show my real life — talk about things that are very hard to talk about and things that I’ve experienced in life but never discussed before.”

So she’s pretty much saying that The World According To Paris and The Simple Life was acting. Give this woman a fucking Golden Globe.

“I was having fun with it. I think, you know. I was in on the joke,” Paris said of the 2003 hit show The Simple Life, which she was pitched as “Green Acres meets Clueless.”

But the 38-year-old heiress is finally reading to show us the real Paris Hilton is her new YouTube documentary.

“In this film I discuss things I’ve never discussed before. I hope that people are going to see who I truly am,” she said.

“It follows me in my real life, everything I’ve done before was me playing a character. I was talking about things that are very hard to talk about. It was an amazing experience but it was very scary. I was freaking out.”

We really shouldn’t be surprised. She comes from a long list of uber-rich billionaire businessmen. The woman has simply mastered the art of branding.

“At the same time, I built a huge brand off doing it,” she told PEOPLE at the event. “So, I don’t really regret it and I’m happy that people are going to finally see this film.”

This Is Paris premieres on YouTube in May 2020.",china yuan strengthens to 6.1696 against usd thursday,0.061466765

"Picking the best games of the decade is an increasingly tough task. The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

"Today, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll look at Hotel Grand Central Limited's (SGX:H18) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Hotel Grand Central has a price to earnings ratio of 38.26, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.6%.

View our latest analysis for Hotel Grand Central

How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Hotel Grand Central:

P/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 ÷ SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Hotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. Although we don't have analyst forecasts you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out this more detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.",japan scrambles jets against russian military planes,0.067888476

Before her 2017 comeback Rainbow, Kesha Sebert couldn’t release music for five years due to a legal battle with her former producer. Finally she’s busy again, with her fourth album on the way.

turkey 's pm warns against protests,"Picking the best games of the decade is an increasingly tough task. The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

Blizzard has done a great job at cultivating “Overwatch” as an esport, and with its Overwatch League moving its teams to local markets in 2020 and a sequel on the way, the future looks bright for the game.",0.07194904

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

"Today, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll look at Hotel Grand Central Limited's (SGX:H18) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Hotel Grand Central has a price to earnings ratio of 38.26, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.6%.

View our latest analysis for Hotel Grand Central

How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Hotel Grand Central:

P/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 ÷ SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Hotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.

The peaceful gathering, organised by the Malaysian Muslim Students Coalition (Gamis), was held despite a warning by the police on Tuesday (Dec 31) that the organiser failed to obtained a permit from Kuala Lumpur City Hall and the police for the march.

Police did not interfere with the protest held outside a popular mall in downtown Kuala Lumur. The college students held up placards and banners while listening to speeches by several speakers.

One large banner in Jawi, complete with a clenched fist painted in red, read, 'People, rise to defend Jawi'. A placard read: 'Undergraduates rise to defend Jawi'.

Earlier, some 150 students had assembled at the historic Masjid Jamek Kuala Lumpur mosque and were planning to march to the mall nearby. But they were advised against doing so by Gamis president Saifullah Baiduri, MalayMail online news reported, because holding a march without a proper permit is forbidden by a local law.

Ethnic tensions rose last week after Chinese education groups - the United Chinese Schools Teachers' Association (Jiao Zong) and the United Chinese School Committees' Association (Dong Zong) - planned to hold a protest congress against Jawi's introduction.

There are more than 1,200 Chinese and 523 Tamil primary schools in Malaysia that use either Mandarin or Tamil as the medium of instruction.

In August, the ministry surprised most people by saying it would include Jawi writing in the Year 4 (Primary 4) syllabus of Bahasa Melayu in the vernacular schools, raising concerns over creeping Islamisation.

These vernacular schools are run independently of national schools, and where the students, mainly Malays, are taught Jawi writing as part of Islamic studies.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.

"Today, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll look at Hotel Grand Central Limited's (SGX:H18) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price.

How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Hotel Grand Central:

P/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 ÷ SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Researchers looked at brain tissue from 56 people who developed encephalitis between 1999 and 2019. Samples revealed that at least eight people who died of encephalitis were infected with Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), Scientific American reported, citing a study recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

MYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA LIKELY CAUSED BY NEW VIRUS, SCIENTISTS SAY

Borna disease (BD), spread by the bicolored white-toothed shrew, is a fatal neurological disease that typically affects horses and sheep and is named after the city in eastern Germany where it first killed hundreds of horses in the 19th century. The findings published in the medical journal “confirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encephalitis,” Scientific American reported.

All eight of those who were infected with BD lived in rural areas and spent a lot of time outdoors. Many of the affected people had been around cats, which are known shrew catchers, as well. Researchers suspect the patients were exposed to the pathogen when the cats presented the dead shrews to their owners. They may have also inhaled dust that contained dried shrew urine (horses and sheep typically are infected after the small mammal urinates in hay.) However, exactly how the virus was transmitted to the patients is not yet known.

As of now, there is no known treatment for the rare virus, which “triggers the host’s immune system to attack brain tissue,” as per Scientific American, and typically causes headache, fever and confusion, which is later followed by “deep coma"" and death. That said, certain antiviral treatments are being considered.

The findings “provide additional material for a better understanding of the disease,” Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany and co-senior author of the study, told the publication. He noted that the risk of infection in humans is “pretty low.”

Moving forward, the researchers urged medical professionals to test for BD in patients with an “unclear cause” of encephalitis.

“BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions,” they wrote.",0.08079377

"Picking the best games of the decade is an increasingly tough task. The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

View our latest analysis for Hotel Grand Central

How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Hotel Grand Central:

P/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 ÷ SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Hotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Hotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.

The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

Blizzard has done a great job at cultivating “Overwatch” as an esport, and with its Overwatch League moving its teams to local markets in 2020 and a sequel on the way, the future looks bright for the game.",0.09463048

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.

"Picking the best games of the decade is an increasingly tough task. The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

Blizzard has done a great job at cultivating “Overwatch” as an esport, and with its Overwatch League moving its teams to local markets in 2020 and a sequel on the way, the future looks bright for the game.",how can i remove this screw ?,0.111402094

We'll look at Hotel Grand Central Limited's (SGX:H18) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Hotel Grand Central has a price to earnings ratio of 38.26, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.6%.

View our latest analysis for Hotel Grand Central

How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Hotel Grand Central:

P/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 ÷ SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Hotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

"At least eight people in Germany who died of encephalitis likely contracted a rare virus from shrews, a small mole-like animal, that led to the fatal brain-swelling condition often caused by a viral infection.

Researchers looked at brain tissue from 56 people who developed encephalitis between 1999 and 2019. Samples revealed that at least eight people who died of encephalitis were infected with Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), Scientific American reported, citing a study recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

MYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA LIKELY CAUSED BY NEW VIRUS, SCIENTISTS SAY

Borna disease (BD), spread by the bicolored white-toothed shrew, is a fatal neurological disease that typically affects horses and sheep and is named after the city in eastern Germany where it first killed hundreds of horses in the 19th century. The findings published in the medical journal “confirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encephalitis,” Scientific American reported.

All eight of those who were infected with BD lived in rural areas and spent a lot of time outdoors. Many of the affected people had been around cats, which are known shrew catchers, as well. Researchers suspect the patients were exposed to the pathogen when the cats presented the dead shrews to their owners. They may have also inhaled dust that contained dried shrew urine (horses and sheep typically are infected after the small mammal urinates in hay.) However, exactly how the virus was transmitted to the patients is not yet known.

As of now, there is no known treatment for the rare virus, which “triggers the host’s immune system to attack brain tissue,” as per Scientific American, and typically causes headache, fever and confusion, which is later followed by “deep coma"" and death. That said, certain antiviral treatments are being considered.

The findings “provide additional material for a better understanding of the disease,” Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany and co-senior author of the study, told the publication. He noted that the risk of infection in humans is “pretty low.”

Moving forward, the researchers urged medical professionals to test for BD in patients with an “unclear cause” of encephalitis.

“BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions,” they wrote.",government of canada supports montréal women leading change,0.14199698
"January is always an exciting time for music fans.

Fresh from trawling the end-of-year lists, now it’s all about the best of what’s to come, with countless new albums on the horizon.

As is always the case at this time of year, the rumour mill is in full motion — Frank Ocean, Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, My Bloody Valentine, The Cure, Haim, Cardi B and many, many more are among the artists on the brink of releasing new music in 2020, depending on who you believe.

Here, we’ve cut through the noise to pick out 10 artists who almost definitely will come through with the goods — five of them have confirmed dates, others are sure to deliver within the next 12 months and the rest have dropped extremely strong hints that albums are on the way.

Halsey — Manic (January 17)

A worldwide arena filler, Ashley “Halsey” Frangipane might still be better known as the voice of other people’s songs. Her two UK number ones have been on Closer by The Chainsmokers and Benny Blanco’s Eastside. But her third album should cement her status as a queen of dark pop, containing hits of her own including Without Me.

Kesha — High Road (January 31)

Before her 2017 comeback Rainbow, Kesha Sebert couldn’t release music for five years due to a legal battle with her former producer. Finally she’s busy again, with her fourth album on the way. Her big voice wraps itself around rowdy pop with a country feel, with plenty of plucked guitar and cameos from Sturgill Simpson and Brian Wilson.

"Picking the best games of the decade is an increasingly tough task. The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

Blizzard has done a great job at cultivating “Overwatch” as an esport, and with its Overwatch League moving its teams to local markets in 2020 and a sequel on the way, the future looks bright for the game.",two killed in arizona skydiving accident,0.15580729

"Authorities have identified the man who was fatally shot in a Renville County home allegedly by his girlfriend who claimed he had taunted her that she wouldn't pull the trigger.

Anthony Tebben, 42, of Hector, died on March 26 at HCMC in Minneapolis from a gunshot to the head earlier that day, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday.

Elizabeth P. Lynch, 35, also of Hector, was charged in District Court with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Lynch remains jailed in lieu of $200,000 bail ahead of her next court appearance on April 24.

According to the criminal complaint:

Lynch called 911 about 1 a.m. and said she shot her boyfriend. She told police that she aimed the handgun at Tebben, unsure whether it was loaded and it fired when she flinched.

Several children were in the home upstairs at the time.

Elizabeth Lynch Credit: Renville County jail

Lynch later told police that she bought the gun a day earlier after getting mad that Tebben threw a plate and broke it.

She said she aimed the gun at Tebben when he came at her aggressively. She said there had been domestic abuse in their relationship.

He responded that she wouldn't shoot him, Lynch said. The gun discharged, Lynch explained, because she flinched and was unfamiliar with how to use the weapon.",please read : ' s piece on the gruesome toll of deadly cluster bombs in # syria :,0.16271406

"In November 2019, the Human Resource Development Ministry wrote to all institutes to ensure implementation of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act.

All 20 Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) have requested the HRD Ministry to exempt them from reserving positions in the teaching staff for Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). The premier business schools, which currently do not offer reservation in teaching positions, have been asked by the Ministry to provide quota in faculty positions for SC, ST, OBC and EWS candidates.

According to officials, the B-schools have made the request saying they adopt a fair recruitment process and give equal opportunities to all, including disadvantaged sections of society. The IIMs have so far been following the 1975-order of the Department of Personnel & Training that exempted scientific and technical posts from the reservation policy. IIM- Ahmedabad is caught in a battle on the issue in the high court. In November 2019, the Human Resource Development Ministry wrote to all institutes to ensure implementation of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act.

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

Blizzard has done a great job at cultivating “Overwatch” as an esport, and with its Overwatch League moving its teams to local markets in 2020 and a sequel on the way, the future looks bright for the game.",74 dead in egypt soccer violence,0.18639807

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

A boy is playing an instrument,"Authorities have identified the man who was fatally shot in a Renville County home allegedly by his girlfriend who claimed he had taunted her that she wouldn't pull the trigger.

Anthony Tebben, 42, of Hector, died on March 26 at HCMC in Minneapolis from a gunshot to the head earlier that day, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday.

Elizabeth P. Lynch, 35, also of Hector, was charged in District Court with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Lynch remains jailed in lieu of $200,000 bail ahead of her next court appearance on April 24.

According to the criminal complaint:

Lynch called 911 about 1 a.m. and said she shot her boyfriend. She told police that she aimed the handgun at Tebben, unsure whether it was loaded and it fired when she flinched.

Several children were in the home upstairs at the time.

Elizabeth Lynch Credit: Renville County jail

Lynch later told police that she bought the gun a day earlier after getting mad that Tebben threw a plate and broke it.

She said she aimed the gun at Tebben when he came at her aggressively. She said there had been domestic abuse in their relationship.

He responded that she wouldn't shoot him, Lynch said. The gun discharged, Lynch explained, because she flinched and was unfamiliar with how to use the weapon.",0.24757533

Anthony Tebben, 42, of Hector, died on March 26 at HCMC in Minneapolis from a gunshot to the head earlier that day, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday.

Elizabeth P. Lynch, 35, also of Hector, was charged in District Court with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Lynch remains jailed in lieu of $200,000 bail ahead of her next court appearance on April 24.

According to the criminal complaint:

Lynch called 911 about 1 a.m. and said she shot her boyfriend. She told police that she aimed the handgun at Tebben, unsure whether it was loaded and it fired when she flinched.

Several children were in the home upstairs at the time.

Lynch later told police that she bought the gun a day earlier after getting mad that Tebben threw a plate and broke it.

She said she aimed the gun at Tebben when he came at her aggressively. She said there had been domestic abuse in their relationship.

He responded that she wouldn't shoot him, Lynch said. The gun discharged, Lynch explained, because she flinched and was unfamiliar with how to use the weapon.",bulb a is in the closed path,0.25053585

The Centre and the Delhi government had challenged the trial court’s order on January 31 that stayed the execution of the convicts – Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) – until further orders. S

Expressing concern over the delay in execution, the victim’s parents urged the court to expeditiously decide the Centre’s plea and were assured by the judge that the order would be passed at the earliest.

Meanwhile, Delhi High Court on Wednesday maintained that all the four convicts will be hanged together. The high court also gave the convicts a week’s time to avail all legal remedies.

On January 7, warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in Tihar jail at 7 AM on January 22 were issued. However, the convicts could not be hanged because of pendency of mercy petition by one of them. Later, the trial court fixed February 1, 6 AM as the hanging date and time. That, too, got delayed in the wake of the legal remedies being exercised by the remaining Nirbhaya convicts.",The doctor is not helping the patient,0.28112528

"KUALA LUMPUR - Some 300 Muslim students gathered on Wednesday (Jan 1) to protest against Chinese educationist group Dong Zong for opposing a Malaysian government's plan to introduce Jawi writing in Chinese and Tamil schools.

The peaceful gathering, organised by the Malaysian Muslim Students Coalition (Gamis), was held despite a warning by the police on Tuesday (Dec 31) that the organiser failed to obtained a permit from Kuala Lumpur City Hall and the police for the march.

Police did not interfere with the protest held outside a popular mall in downtown Kuala Lumur. The college students held up placards and banners while listening to speeches by several speakers.

One large banner in Jawi, complete with a clenched fist painted in red, read, 'People, rise to defend Jawi'. A placard read: 'Undergraduates rise to defend Jawi'.

Earlier, some 150 students had assembled at the historic Masjid Jamek Kuala Lumpur mosque and were planning to march to the mall nearby. But they were advised against doing so by Gamis president Saifullah Baiduri, MalayMail online news reported, because holding a march without a proper permit is forbidden by a local law.

Ethnic tensions rose last week after Chinese education groups - the United Chinese Schools Teachers' Association (Jiao Zong) and the United Chinese School Committees' Association (Dong Zong) - planned to hold a protest congress against Jawi's introduction.

There are more than 1,200 Chinese and 523 Tamil primary schools in Malaysia that use either Mandarin or Tamil as the medium of instruction.

In August, the ministry surprised most people by saying it would include Jawi writing in the Year 4 (Primary 4) syllabus of Bahasa Melayu in the vernacular schools, raising concerns over creeping Islamisation.

These vernacular schools are run independently of national schools, and where the students, mainly Malays, are taught Jawi writing as part of Islamic studies.

The police obtained a court order to stop the congress planned by the Chinese education groups, but allowed a National Jawi Congress to proceed on Sunday.

The organisers of Sunday's congress that included prominent political activists urged the government to put on hold the teaching of a Jawi calligraphy module in the vernacular schools.",chinese stocks close higher midday friday,0.30381978

"KUALA LUMPUR - Some 300 Muslim students gathered on Wednesday (Jan 1) to protest against Chinese educationist group Dong Zong for opposing a Malaysian government's plan to introduce Jawi writing in Chinese and Tamil schools.

The peaceful gathering, organised by the Malaysian Muslim Students Coalition (Gamis), was held despite a warning by the police on Tuesday (Dec 31) that the organiser failed to obtained a permit from Kuala Lumpur City Hall and the police for the march.

Police did not interfere with the protest held outside a popular mall in downtown Kuala Lumur. The college students held up placards and banners while listening to speeches by several speakers.

One large banner in Jawi, complete with a clenched fist painted in red, read, 'People, rise to defend Jawi'. A placard read: 'Undergraduates rise to defend Jawi'.

Earlier, some 150 students had assembled at the historic Masjid Jamek Kuala Lumpur mosque and were planning to march to the mall nearby. But they were advised against doing so by Gamis president Saifullah Baiduri, MalayMail online news reported, because holding a march without a proper permit is forbidden by a local law.

Ethnic tensions rose last week after Chinese education groups - the United Chinese Schools Teachers' Association (Jiao Zong) and the United Chinese School Committees' Association (Dong Zong) - planned to hold a protest congress against Jawi's introduction.

There are more than 1,200 Chinese and 523 Tamil primary schools in Malaysia that use either Mandarin or Tamil as the medium of instruction.

In August, the ministry surprised most people by saying it would include Jawi writing in the Year 4 (Primary 4) syllabus of Bahasa Melayu in the vernacular schools, raising concerns over creeping Islamisation.

These vernacular schools are run independently of national schools, and where the students, mainly Malays, are taught Jawi writing as part of Islamic studies.

The police obtained a court order to stop the congress planned by the Chinese education groups, but allowed a National Jawi Congress to proceed on Sunday.
