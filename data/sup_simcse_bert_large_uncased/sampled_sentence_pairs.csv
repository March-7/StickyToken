The War of the Realms ravaged Thor's homeland, but by the end of the event, Odin the All-Father stepped down and crowned Thor as the new King of Asgard. Now, months after the end of the war, Thor has rebuilt his home. Gone are the shimmering golden palaces of his father's creation, with the seat of the king remade in wood and stone. But now what was once a golden paradise, remade into a medieval city, shaped by hammers... has just been rocked by the arrival of Galactus in Marvel's shocking Thor #1.

As Thor readies himself to give his first speech to the Asgardians gathered around their new king -- a message readers can only assume would have reflected the same message sent by the remade land itself, Galactus comes plummeting down from the sky, smashing directly into city's inhabitants, and Thor instantly realizing that scores of his people will never get the chance to hear a speech ever again.

The sight of Galactus wrapped in machine armor, decimating the crowd is a horrifying one, to be sure. Screams are heard, as bolts of lightning mark Thor's leap into the fight, prepared to kill Galactus for this invasion of his people's new home. Thankfully Thor has the presence of mind to stop before then, stopping short as Galactus pleads with Thor to understand the reason for his arrival. He has come to Asgard for help, since Thor is the only one who can stop the Great Black Winter. The newest unknown threat to Thor (and all life in the universe), and one that can only be stopped if Thor becomes the newest herald of Galactus.

Right on cue the mourning rains of Asgard begin to fall, carrying on for weeks. The city officials of Asgard work, busying themselves with counting the dead and calculating the cost of Galactus's 'arrival.' And while they may try to ignore the silence of their new king, it is evident more than just Asgard's people died the day Galactus fell. Galactus' impact also means that Yggdrasil, the tree of life, has begun to die. How will thor possibly manage to correct these tragedies, and return to his brighter vision for Asgard's future? To have those questions answered, readers will need to pick up Thor #1! Find the full details below.

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

deputy speaker faces new sex claims,"Birds of Prey is a lot of fun. I don't think it's the best of the recent DC films, but it's certainly plenty entertaining – and deserved a much better reception than it got in theaters. Now, Warner Bros. is gearing up to drop the movie onto digital early, and I'm hopeful more folks will discover it there. If you haven't seen it yet, and want some indication of the tone of the flick, you might want to check out the featurette above. It's pretty extensive – it runs a little over 8 minutes – and covers a lot of bases. Star Margot Robbie talks about how she pitched the entire idea for the film, and then met with screenwriter Christina Hodson about the project. From there we learn about Cathy Yan being brought on to direct the film, the casting, the action, and more. This is actually one of several features included on the home media release. Here's a full list of what else is included.

'Gorilla Kidogo and his family are alive', the zoo wrote on Facebook in the early hours of today. Both the zoo and city officials said that they didn't know the exact cause of the fire and that police are investigating. They would not confirm reports by local media that New Year's fireworks could have sparked the killer blaze. However, reports from the scene claim three banned sky lanterns were found in the charred remains of the enclosure.

The greenhouse-style building - which opened in 1975 - burned to the ground within a couple of hours, say reports.

Orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, marmosets, epaulet fruit bats and birds were inside at the time.

"The Abia state police command has vowed to disrupt the funeral of the parents of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), if members of the group showed up.

Ene Okon, Abia commissioner of police, said the burial of Eze Kanu and his wife, king and queen of Afaraukwu, will not take place with the presence of IPOB members.

Okon who said this while speaking with The Sun, said he had informed the traditional prime minister of Afaraukwu that the police would provide security for the burial if only IPOB members do not show up.

“I have already reached out to the traditional prime minister of Afaraukwu (Nnamdi Kanu’s community) and told him that if they want the burial to go smoothly and for police to give them security, they should tell IPOB not to near the area not to talk of participating in the burial,” he said.

“If they fail to adhere to what we’ve told them, that means they do not want the burial to go on smoothly because we are going to scatter the place. IPOB is proscribed by the federal government. I, as the commissioner of police in Abia cannot sit here and allow any proscribed group to operate anywhere in this state.

“I am saying this again for emphasis that there is no way police will allow a proscribed group to participate in the burial of the king and queen of Afaraukwu simply because they are the parents of their acclaimed leader, we will not allow that and we cannot take anything for granted in the face of abundant intelligence on threat by IPOB.”

"Saudi Arabia will enforce a round-the-clock nationwide curfew during the five-day Eid al-Fitr holiday later this month to fight the coronavirus, the interior ministry said Tuesday, as infections spike.

The kingdom, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in the Gulf region, is scrambling to limit the spread of the deadly disease.

A full lockdown will be reimposed around the country from May 23-27, the ministry said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. The period coincides with the Muslim festival that marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

Most parts of the kingdom were put under full lockdown following the outbreak, but last month the government relaxed the curfew between the hours of 9am and 5pm.

Malls and retailers have been allowed to reopen, except in major hotspots including the holy city of Mecca -- where confirmed cases have soared, despite a stringent lockdown.

The health ministry said Tuesday the number of COVID-19 deaths had risen to 264 and confirmed infections to 42,925, while 15,257 people have recovered.

In March, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round ""umrah"" pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading in Islam's holiest cities.

Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year's hajj -- scheduled for late July -- but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage.

Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once during their lifetime.

The Arab world's biggest economy has also closed cinemas and restaurants and halted flights as it attempts to contain the virus.

King Salman has warned of a ""more difficult"" fight ahead against COVID-19, as the kingdom faces the double blow of virus-led shutdowns and crashing oil prices.","insight : u.n. chief finds his voice , but remains cautious on china",0.5253521

"This article contains spoilers for Thor #1!

Thor has just become more powerful than ever before. Jason Aaron's years-long Thor run has come to a dramatic close, and it's time for a fresh beginning for the God of Thunder. Aaron ended with Thor regaining his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, and taking the throne of the All-Father of Asgard.

Step forward Donny Cates, who's becoming one of Marvel's most prolific writers and the architect of all their cosmic plots. The first issue of Cates' Thor relaunch sees the God of Thunder prepare to give a speech to his people, one that's interrupted by the untimely arrival of Galactus, dying after exposure to a cosmic force known as the Great Black Winter.

According to Galactus, the Great Black Winter has revealed that Thor is destined to be his death. As a result, operating under the principle of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Galactus appoints Thor Odinson as his new Herald, transforming him with the Power Cosmic. In the Directors' Cut, Cates describes the transformation like this:

Thor rises, and he has been remade. His arm is back, as is his eye, and his hair is now LONG. Like down to his butt long. Like the nineties Thor that I love. He's also wearing a slick new costume, very sci-fi and slick. Mostly black and bright white. The white on his costume should be glowing like lightning. And the black should be made of a star field. His eyes glow as well. Crackling with energy. His hammer, a solid Mjolnir-shaped bolt of lightning. He has become cosmic-Zeus! His run sigil emblazoned on his chest. Smoke pouring off him.

This is easily the most phenomenal power-up Thor has ever received. He's never exactly been a weakling, but now he possesses all the power of the God of Thunder; wields an enchanted hammer containing a God Tempest that can destroy entire star systems; has been granted the power of the All-Father himself; and also wields the Power Cosmic, meaning he should have all the powers of any other Herald of Galactus. He's officially the strongest Avenger, the mightiest god in any of Marvel's Pantheons, and the greatest Herald ever to serve Galactus.

Donny Cates is a smart writer. That means he wouldn't have given Thor this level of power if he didn't have a story in mind that would demand it. What's more, in interviews Cates has insisted he still sees Thor as a young god, a flawed man given to fits of temper and in danger of being overcome by his own ego and pride. Galactus' prophecy - foretelling that the God of Thunder will, in fact, be the one responsible for his own destruction - suggests that Thor Odinson may well not be able to handle the vast, unfathomable powers that are now at his disposal. Will absolute power corrupt absolutely?

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.",large white cruise ship floating on water .,0.53466237

The greenhouse-style building - which opened in 1975 - burned to the ground within a couple of hours, say reports.

Orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, marmosets, epaulet fruit bats and birds were inside at the time.

"The Abia state police command has vowed to disrupt the funeral of the parents of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), if members of the group showed up.

Ene Okon, Abia commissioner of police, said the burial of Eze Kanu and his wife, king and queen of Afaraukwu, will not take place with the presence of IPOB members.

Okon who said this while speaking with The Sun, said he had informed the traditional prime minister of Afaraukwu that the police would provide security for the burial if only IPOB members do not show up.

“I have already reached out to the traditional prime minister of Afaraukwu (Nnamdi Kanu’s community) and told him that if they want the burial to go smoothly and for police to give them security, they should tell IPOB not to near the area not to talk of participating in the burial,” he said.

“If they fail to adhere to what we’ve told them, that means they do not want the burial to go on smoothly because we are going to scatter the place. IPOB is proscribed by the federal government. I, as the commissioner of police in Abia cannot sit here and allow any proscribed group to operate anywhere in this state.

“I am saying this again for emphasis that there is no way police will allow a proscribed group to participate in the burial of the king and queen of Afaraukwu simply because they are the parents of their acclaimed leader, we will not allow that and we cannot take anything for granted in the face of abundant intelligence on threat by IPOB.”

The CP said members can attend the event individually, but that the police would react if IPOB flag, insignia or any form of identification is seen.","boston bombing suspect was under fbi surveillance , says mother",0.54582274

"Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

The hosts actually do a lot of stuff during filming that viewers don't get to see, like provide moral support to the contestants. We started to see more of this with Sandi and Noel but almost never with Mel and Sue because one of them would start cursing to the camera while the other talked the contestant off a cliff (the BBC couldn't air any of this footage because of the cursing).



I'll admit that sometimes the hosts' jokes are bad but GBBO would be missing something without its hosts.

"By Rachel Noll, DOC Communications

The Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) is privileged to have staff well trained in emergency management. During statewide and national emergencies, the DOC stands ready to respond internally to protect the health and safety of staff and the incarcerated, and externally to provide support to other state or federal agencies.

Steps Taken During COVID-19

Corrections began supporting the Department of Health (DOH) response to COVID-19 on February 9, 2020, by providing members of Corrections’ Department Incident Management Team (DIMT) to help the statewide response. The department officially opened its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at headquarters in response to COVID-19 on March 2, 2020, whose members represent every division across the agency.

While the state is under a “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order, Corrections remains open and operational as an essential business. The safety and well-being of the incarcerated, staff and public are the department’s top priorities.

Corrections has taken a number of steps to ensure the safety of those incarcerated in correctional facilities and work release, as well as those on community supervision. These steps include suspending visitation and other in-person programming to reduce outside exposure, encouraging pro-active precautions like hand-washing, extra cleaning and social distancing, and reducing the number of face-to-face contact visits community corrections officers have to make with those they supervise.

The department is also encouraging staff to stay home when sick, practice social distancing and telework wherever possible. Every staff member that needs to report in person for work receives a verbal and temperature health screening when they enter any correctional facility. The agency recently approved staff to wear expired N95 respirators (pdf). The department continues to monitor the situation to determine if additional steps are necessary as new guidance is made available.

To demonstrate the department’s commitment to openness and transparency, Corrections has posted important information on the COVID-19 Information Center, including memos, resources and decision points.

Current Protocols Followed

Corrections’ Chief Medical Officer and her team have developed protocols (pdf) that follow recommendations for isolation and quarantine set forth by DOH and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which are updated as needed to reflect the latest guidance.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 self-quarantine at home for at least 14 days. Corrections also works to identify and notify employees considered to have had close contact with a staff member with positive COVID-19 test results. Those determined to have been in close contact with the positive individual will be asked to self-quarantine at home for up to 14 days from the date of last contact with the employee who tested positive, following DOH guidelines.

If an incarcerated individual shows symptoms or tests positive, they will be isolated and treated. Those who have been in contact will be quarantined even if they are asymptomatic under the same guidelines followed under other quarantines, such as those that occur during outbreaks of the stomach flu.

Corrections Assistance in Statewide Response

In addition to the internal response, the DIMT provided logistics support to DOH along with the Washington Department of Social and Health Services and the Washington Military Department – Emergency Management Division with the statewide response to COVID-19. The support is possible because the Department of Corrections trains employees in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the national structure for emergency response enabling state and federal agencies that typically do not work together, to operate under the same structure and unified command during an emergency.

“Real world emergencies, whether it be a flood, hurricane, volcano or pandemic, provide the opportunity for our agency employees to hone their skills in emergency management and incident command,” said Emergency Operations Manager Greg Miller. “Assisting other agencies drastically increases our knowledge, skills and abilities to manage our own emergencies when they arise in the department. Above and beyond DIMT, the Department of Corrections staff statewide are always ready and willing to help out. These staff are doing great work in the offices, prisons and community during this time.”

The DIMT provided Command, Logistics and Planning staff to the Unified Command at the State Emergency Operations Center. DOC staff also provided communications support as the state stood up its Joint Information Center. Working together during an emergency allows each state agency to continue its operations, work together as a team and have a role in helping Washington to ‘flatten the curve’.

Incarcerated individuals have also expressed a desire to help. Correctional Industries (CI) workers at Coyote Ridge Corrections Center have adapted their knowledge from the textile factory to produce protective gowns to respond to the need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CI workers across the state are also working to produce additional gowns, protective masks and face shields.

“Partnerships such as this show the department’s commitment to both our mission, ‘To improve public safety by positively changing lives’ as well as our vision, ‘Working together for safer communities,’” said Secretary Steve Sinclair. “Corrections is committed to working together with other state agencies to help support the best emergency response possible, as we know our role in creating safer communities extends beyond our commitment to operating a safe and humane corrections system. We value our partnership with others as we work to transform lives for a better Washington.”",stocking is very subjective to the specific inhabitants as well as the setup and your aquarium experience .,0.5811995

"Saudi Arabia will enforce a round-the-clock nationwide curfew during the five-day Eid al-Fitr holiday later this month to fight the coronavirus, the interior ministry said Tuesday, as infections spike.

The kingdom, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in the Gulf region, is scrambling to limit the spread of the deadly disease.

A full lockdown will be reimposed around the country from May 23-27, the ministry said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. The period coincides with the Muslim festival that marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

Most parts of the kingdom were put under full lockdown following the outbreak, but last month the government relaxed the curfew between the hours of 9am and 5pm.

Malls and retailers have been allowed to reopen, except in major hotspots including the holy city of Mecca -- where confirmed cases have soared, despite a stringent lockdown.

The health ministry said Tuesday the number of COVID-19 deaths had risen to 264 and confirmed infections to 42,925, while 15,257 people have recovered.

In March, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round ""umrah"" pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading in Islam's holiest cities.

Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year's hajj -- scheduled for late July -- but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage.

Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once during their lifetime.

The Arab world's biggest economy has also closed cinemas and restaurants and halted flights as it attempts to contain the virus.

Corrections’ Chief Medical Officer and her team have developed protocols (pdf) that follow recommendations for isolation and quarantine set forth by DOH and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which are updated as needed to reflect the latest guidance.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 self-quarantine at home for at least 14 days. Corrections also works to identify and notify employees considered to have had close contact with a staff member with positive COVID-19 test results. Those determined to have been in close contact with the positive individual will be asked to self-quarantine at home for up to 14 days from the date of last contact with the employee who tested positive, following DOH guidelines.

If an incarcerated individual shows symptoms or tests positive, they will be isolated and treated. Those who have been in contact will be quarantined even if they are asymptomatic under the same guidelines followed under other quarantines, such as those that occur during outbreaks of the stomach flu.

Corrections Assistance in Statewide Response

In addition to the internal response, the DIMT provided logistics support to DOH along with the Washington Department of Social and Health Services and the Washington Military Department – Emergency Management Division with the statewide response to COVID-19. The support is possible because the Department of Corrections trains employees in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the national structure for emergency response enabling state and federal agencies that typically do not work together, to operate under the same structure and unified command during an emergency.

“Real world emergencies, whether it be a flood, hurricane, volcano or pandemic, provide the opportunity for our agency employees to hone their skills in emergency management and incident command,” said Emergency Operations Manager Greg Miller. “Assisting other agencies drastically increases our knowledge, skills and abilities to manage our own emergencies when they arise in the department. Above and beyond DIMT, the Department of Corrections staff statewide are always ready and willing to help out. These staff are doing great work in the offices, prisons and community during this time.”

The DIMT provided Command, Logistics and Planning staff to the Unified Command at the State Emergency Operations Center. DOC staff also provided communications support as the state stood up its Joint Information Center. Working together during an emergency allows each state agency to continue its operations, work together as a team and have a role in helping Washington to ‘flatten the curve’.

Incarcerated individuals have also expressed a desire to help. Correctional Industries (CI) workers at Coyote Ridge Corrections Center have adapted their knowledge from the textile factory to produce protective gowns to respond to the need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CI workers across the state are also working to produce additional gowns, protective masks and face shields.

“Partnerships such as this show the department’s commitment to both our mission, ‘To improve public safety by positively changing lives’ as well as our vision, ‘Working together for safer communities,’” said Secretary Steve Sinclair. “Corrections is committed to working together with other state agencies to help support the best emergency response possible, as we know our role in creating safer communities extends beyond our commitment to operating a safe and humane corrections system. We value our partnership with others as we work to transform lives for a better Washington.”",u.s. relaxes deportation rules for young people : napolitano,0.59422493

Krefeld Zoo - located north of Dusseldorf and near the Dutch border - said its ""worst fears have become reality"" in the wake of this morning's shocking fire.

In a post on Facebook, it said: ""An unfathomable tragedy hit us shortly after midnight. Our ape building burned down to the foundation.""

Chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans are among those that burned alive. Fruit bats, birds and other animals were also killed.

However, two chimps called Bally and Limbo were saved from the flames by firefighters who heard their screams.

Both suffered minor burns and the zoo director described their last minute rescue as nothing short of ""a miracle"".

'Gorilla Kidogo and his family are alive', the zoo wrote on Facebook in the early hours of today. Both the zoo and city officials said that they didn't know the exact cause of the fire and that police are investigating. They would not confirm reports by local media that New Year's fireworks could have sparked the killer blaze. However, reports from the scene claim three banned sky lanterns were found in the charred remains of the enclosure.

The Zoo said it was thankful for the many offers of help, but added: ""We are still in shock and cannot yet say exactly if and where help is needed.""

The greenhouse-style building - which opened in 1975 - burned to the ground within a couple of hours, say reports.

Orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, marmosets, epaulet fruit bats and birds were inside at the time.

"Warning: SPOILERS for Thor #1

The War of the Realms ravaged Thor's homeland, but by the end of the event, Odin the All-Father stepped down and crowned Thor as the new King of Asgard. Now, months after the end of the war, Thor has rebuilt his home. Gone are the shimmering golden palaces of his father's creation, with the seat of the king remade in wood and stone. But now what was once a golden paradise, remade into a medieval city, shaped by hammers... has just been rocked by the arrival of Galactus in Marvel's shocking Thor #1.

As Thor readies himself to give his first speech to the Asgardians gathered around their new king -- a message readers can only assume would have reflected the same message sent by the remade land itself, Galactus comes plummeting down from the sky, smashing directly into city's inhabitants, and Thor instantly realizing that scores of his people will never get the chance to hear a speech ever again.

Screams are heard, as bolts of lightning mark Thor's leap into the fight, prepared to kill Galactus for this invasion of his people's new home. Thankfully Thor has the presence of mind to stop before then, stopping short as Galactus pleads with Thor to understand the reason for his arrival. He has come to Asgard for help, since Thor is the only one who can stop the Great Black Winter.

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.","spokesman james howe said five children aged between 4 and 17 were taken to hospital with neck and chest injuries , while three others were treated at the scene .",0.64075166
"Saudi Arabia will enforce a round-the-clock nationwide curfew during the five-day Eid al-Fitr holiday later this month to fight the coronavirus, the interior ministry said Tuesday, as infections spike.

The kingdom, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in the Gulf region, is scrambling to limit the spread of the deadly disease.

A full lockdown will be reimposed around the country from May 23-27, the ministry said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. The period coincides with the Muslim festival that marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

Most parts of the kingdom were put under full lockdown following the outbreak, but last month the government relaxed the curfew between the hours of 9am and 5pm.

Malls and retailers have been allowed to reopen, except in major hotspots including the holy city of Mecca -- where confirmed cases have soared, despite a stringent lockdown.

The health ministry said Tuesday the number of COVID-19 deaths had risen to 264 and confirmed infections to 42,925, while 15,257 people have recovered.

In March, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round ""umrah"" pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading in Islam's holiest cities.

Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year's hajj -- scheduled for late July -- but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage.

Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once during their lifetime.

The Arab world's biggest economy has also closed cinemas and restaurants and halted flights as it attempts to contain the virus.

"NEW DELHI: The restrictions imposed by the army on its personnel and formations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is posing challenges to its internal functioning.Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties. While this is also affecting the training routines of troops, reduction in attendance at the headquarters is set to slow down other work as well, said officials.The steps are aimed at ensuring social distancing and preventing contagion. It has created an unprecedented situation, forcing the army to improvise, especially because troops eat, sleep and train together within confined spaces. For example, one particular unit has now divided troops into teams that live in different areas, while ensuring that only one team uses the common toilets at a time. Training is conducted in small batches, and the equipment is sanitised every time it is used.The army on Monday issued fresh instructions to all its military stations, cantonments, units and formations in the 82 districts under lockdown. These include restricted movements, functioning of only those personnel engaged in essential services and the closure of all CSD canteens Officials said the reduction in manpower in some of the army’s formations was due to the extension of leave of soldiers till April 15 and placing those who recently returned on quarantine. Those who are going on leave due to an emergency in their families will be sent for a minimum period of 30 days. “We are in a situation where we are slightly less in strength. It affects day-to-day functioning, administrative and security duties. There is an increase in the workload of those on guard duties, because there is less turnover of troops,” an official said.The manpower also gets affected because troops are tasked with manning the quarantine facilities setup by the army. However, officials said the situation was not “alarming”, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army’s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept. Last week, the army passed instructions that 35% officers and 50% junior commissioned officers (JCO) and other ranks (OR) would work from home for a week from Monday, while the next group would do this starting March 30. The lockdown in Delhi is also affecting the travel of those personnel who stay in Gurgaon and Uttar Pradesh.“Work at the headquarters has slowed, as we are working with bare essentials. The deadline for work such as submitting reports will be extended. Only emergency work will continue as it was,” an official said.The army’s complaints section for now will only be dealing with cases that are urgent. Officials said rosters had been created to divide the staff between those who work at home and those who come to the office. However, it remains to be seen what work will be given to those working from home, because files cannot be taken home due to confidentiality issues. Several issues also cannot be communicated over email due to cybersecurity threats. Moreover, JCOs and ORs are mainly clerks who are part of the filing system for letters and documents, which can be done only from the offices.Officials said training of troops had also reduced. However, this will not affect operational preparedness, because it is for a short duration and can be made up later.In relation to the unit mentioned earlier, training of troops has become more “concentrated”, because smaller batches are being trained. “This has given us an opportunity to train better. Training small groups ensures that everyone’s doubts are cleared and attention is given to each aspect. But due to the pandemic, we have to sanitise an equipment every time it is used,” an official said.This type of training comes after troops were divided into small teams that maintained a distance of 200 metre between each other. It is also being ensured that distances are being maintained between troops of a team. “Only one team can use a bathroom at a time. After the team is done, the bathroom is sanitised and only then can the other team use it. We also have separate timings for eating at the cookhouse for the teams,” the official said.A major concern for the army stations and cantonments, which are isolated areas in a city, is the civilian manpower that is coming from outside. For example, washing points and blow drying of clothes have been setup outside the gates of one of the cantonments for this manpower.",( cause to ) become less intense or strict,0.67336094

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.","as of this week , 103 human west nile cases in 45 counties had been reported to the health department .",0.6938062

"This article contains spoilers for Thor #1!

Thor has just become more powerful than ever before. Jason Aaron's years-long Thor run has come to a dramatic close, and it's time for a fresh beginning for the God of Thunder. Aaron ended with Thor regaining his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, and taking the throne of the All-Father of Asgard.

Step forward Donny Cates, who's becoming one of Marvel's most prolific writers and the architect of all their cosmic plots. The first issue of Cates' Thor relaunch sees the God of Thunder prepare to give a speech to his people, one that's interrupted by the untimely arrival of Galactus, dying after exposure to a cosmic force known as the Great Black Winter.

According to Galactus, the Great Black Winter has revealed that Thor is destined to be his death. As a result, operating under the principle of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Galactus appoints Thor Odinson as his new Herald, transforming him with the Power Cosmic. In the Directors' Cut, Cates describes the transformation like this:

Thor rises, and he has been remade. His arm is back, as is his eye, and his hair is now LONG. Like down to his butt long. Like the nineties Thor that I love. He's also wearing a slick new costume, very sci-fi and slick. Mostly black and bright white. The white on his costume should be glowing like lightning. And the black should be made of a star field. His eyes glow as well. Crackling with energy. His hammer, a solid Mjolnir-shaped bolt of lightning. He has become cosmic-Zeus! His run sigil emblazoned on his chest. Smoke pouring off him.

This is easily the most phenomenal power-up Thor has ever received. He's never exactly been a weakling, but now he possesses all the power of the God of Thunder; wields an enchanted hammer containing a God Tempest that can destroy entire star systems; has been granted the power of the All-Father himself; and also wields the Power Cosmic, meaning he should have all the powers of any other Herald of Galactus. He's officially the strongest Avenger, the mightiest god in any of Marvel's Pantheons, and the greatest Herald ever to serve Galactus.

Donny Cates is a smart writer. That means he wouldn't have given Thor this level of power if he didn't have a story in mind that would demand it. What's more, in interviews Cates has insisted he still sees Thor as a young god, a flawed man given to fits of temper and in danger of being overcome by his own ego and pride. Galactus' prophecy - foretelling that the God of Thunder will, in fact, be the one responsible for his own destruction - suggests that Thor Odinson may well not be able to handle the vast, unfathomable powers that are now at his disposal. Will absolute power corrupt absolutely?

I don't think it's the best of the recent DC films, but it's certainly plenty entertaining – and deserved a much better reception than it got in theaters. Now, Warner Bros. is gearing up to drop the movie onto digital early, and I'm hopeful more folks will discover it there. If you haven't seen it yet, and want some indication of the tone of the flick, you might want to check out the featurette above. It's pretty extensive – it runs a little over 8 minutes – and covers a lot of bases. Star Margot Robbie talks about how she pitched the entire idea for the film, and then met with screenwriter Christina Hodson about the project. From there we learn about Cathy Yan being brought on to direct the film, the casting, the action, and more. This is actually one of several features included on the home media release. Here's a full list of what else is included.

"this method is used in the google toolbar , which reports back actual site visits to google .","Google last week said that this summer Chrome will remove resource-hogging web advertisements from websites, including ads that mask unauthorized crypto-mining operations.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.",0.7477027

"NEW DELHI: The restrictions imposed by the army on its personnel and formations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is posing challenges to its internal functioning.Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties. While this is also affecting the training routines of troops, reduction in attendance at the headquarters is set to slow down other work as well, said officials.The steps are aimed at ensuring social distancing and preventing contagion. It has created an unprecedented situation, forcing the army to improvise, especially because troops eat, sleep and train together within confined spaces. For example, one particular unit has now divided troops into teams that live in different areas, while ensuring that only one team uses the common toilets at a time. Training is conducted in small batches, and the equipment is sanitised every time it is used.The army on Monday issued fresh instructions to all its military stations, cantonments, units and formations in the 82 districts under lockdown. These include restricted movements, functioning of only those personnel engaged in essential services and the closure of all CSD canteens Officials said the reduction in manpower in some of the army’s formations was due to the extension of leave of soldiers till April 15 and placing those who recently returned on quarantine. Those who are going on leave due to an emergency in their families will be sent for a minimum period of 30 days. “We are in a situation where we are slightly less in strength. It affects day-to-day functioning, administrative and security duties. There is an increase in the workload of those on guard duties, because there is less turnover of troops,” an official said.The manpower also gets affected because troops are tasked with manning the quarantine facilities setup by the army. However, officials said the situation was not “alarming”, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army’s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept. Last week, the army passed instructions that 35% officers and 50% junior commissioned officers (JCO) and other ranks (OR) would work from home for a week from Monday, while the next group would do this starting March 30. The lockdown in Delhi is also affecting the travel of those personnel who stay in Gurgaon and Uttar Pradesh.“Work at the headquarters has slowed, as we are working with bare essentials. The deadline for work such as submitting reports will be extended. Only emergency work will continue as it was,” an official said.The army’s complaints section for now will only be dealing with cases that are urgent. Officials said rosters had been created to divide the staff between those who work at home and those who come to the office. However, it remains to be seen what work will be given to those working from home, because files cannot be taken home due to confidentiality issues. Several issues also cannot be communicated over email due to cybersecurity threats. Moreover, JCOs and ORs are mainly clerks who are part of the filing system for letters and documents, which can be done only from the offices.Officials said training of troops had also reduced. However, this will not affect operational preparedness, because it is for a short duration and can be made up later.In relation to the unit mentioned earlier, training of troops has become more “concentrated”, because smaller batches are being trained. “This has given us an opportunity to train better. Training small groups ensures that everyone’s doubts are cleared and attention is given to each aspect. But due to the pandemic, we have to sanitise an equipment every time it is used,” an official said.This type of training comes after troops were divided into small teams that maintained a distance of 200 metre between each other. It is also being ensured that distances are being maintained between troops of a team. “Only one team can use a bathroom at a time. After the team is done, the bathroom is sanitised and only then can the other team use it. We also have separate timings for eating at the cookhouse for the teams,” the official said.A major concern for the army stations and cantonments, which are isolated areas in a city, is the civilian manpower that is coming from outside. For example, washing points and blow drying of clothes have been setup outside the gates of one of the cantonments for this manpower.","Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.",0.75504714

The Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) is privileged to have staff well trained in emergency management. During statewide and national emergencies, the DOC stands ready to respond internally to protect the health and safety of staff and the incarcerated, and externally to provide support to other state or federal agencies.

Steps Taken During COVID-19

Corrections began supporting the Department of Health (DOH) response to COVID-19 on February 9, 2020, by providing members of Corrections’ Department Incident Management Team (DIMT) to help the statewide response. The department officially opened its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at headquarters in response to COVID-19 on March 2, 2020, whose members represent every division across the agency.

While the state is under a “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order, Corrections remains open and operational as an essential business. The safety and well-being of the incarcerated, staff and public are the department’s top priorities.

Corrections has taken a number of steps to ensure the safety of those incarcerated in correctional facilities and work release, as well as those on community supervision. These steps include suspending visitation and other in-person programming to reduce outside exposure, encouraging pro-active precautions like hand-washing, extra cleaning and social distancing, and reducing the number of face-to-face contact visits community corrections officers have to make with those they supervise.

The department is also encouraging staff to stay home when sick, practice social distancing and telework wherever possible. Every staff member that needs to report in person for work receives a verbal and temperature health screening when they enter any correctional facility. The agency recently approved staff to wear expired N95 respirators (pdf). The department continues to monitor the situation to determine if additional steps are necessary as new guidance is made available.

To demonstrate the department’s commitment to openness and transparency, Corrections has posted important information on the COVID-19 Information Center, including memos, resources and decision points.

Current Protocols Followed

Corrections’ Chief Medical Officer and her team have developed protocols (pdf) that follow recommendations for isolation and quarantine set forth by DOH and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which are updated as needed to reflect the latest guidance.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 self-quarantine at home for at least 14 days. Corrections also works to identify and notify employees considered to have had close contact with a staff member with positive COVID-19 test results. Those determined to have been in close contact with the positive individual will be asked to self-quarantine at home for up to 14 days from the date of last contact with the employee who tested positive, following DOH guidelines.

If an incarcerated individual shows symptoms or tests positive, they will be isolated and treated. Those who have been in contact will be quarantined even if they are asymptomatic under the same guidelines followed under other quarantines, such as those that occur during outbreaks of the stomach flu.

Corrections Assistance in Statewide Response

In addition to the internal response, the DIMT provided logistics support to DOH along with the Washington Department of Social and Health Services and the Washington Military Department – Emergency Management Division with the statewide response to COVID-19. The support is possible because the Department of Corrections trains employees in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the national structure for emergency response enabling state and federal agencies that typically do not work together, to operate under the same structure and unified command during an emergency.

“Real world emergencies, whether it be a flood, hurricane, volcano or pandemic, provide the opportunity for our agency employees to hone their skills in emergency management and incident command,” said Emergency Operations Manager Greg Miller. “Assisting other agencies drastically increases our knowledge, skills and abilities to manage our own emergencies when they arise in the department. Above and beyond DIMT, the Department of Corrections staff statewide are always ready and willing to help out. These staff are doing great work in the offices, prisons and community during this time.”

The DIMT provided Command, Logistics and Planning staff to the Unified Command at the State Emergency Operations Center. DOC staff also provided communications support as the state stood up its Joint Information Center. Working together during an emergency allows each state agency to continue its operations, work together as a team and have a role in helping Washington to ‘flatten the curve’.

Incarcerated individuals have also expressed a desire to help. Correctional Industries (CI) workers at Coyote Ridge Corrections Center have adapted their knowledge from the textile factory to produce protective gowns to respond to the need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CI workers across the state are also working to produce additional gowns, protective masks and face shields.

“Partnerships such as this show the department’s commitment to both our mission, ‘To improve public safety by positively changing lives’ as well as our vision, ‘Working together for safer communities,’” said Secretary Steve Sinclair. “Corrections is committed to working together with other state agencies to help support the best emergency response possible, as we know our role in creating safer communities extends beyond our commitment to operating a safe and humane corrections system. We value our partnership with others as we work to transform lives for a better Washington.”",0.76055896

However, officials said the situation was not “alarming”, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army’s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept. Last week, the army passed instructions that 35% officers and 50% junior commissioned officers (JCO) and other ranks (OR) would work from home for a week from Monday, while the next group would do this starting March 30. The lockdown in Delhi is also affecting the travel of those personnel who stay in Gurgaon and Uttar Pradesh.“Work at the headquarters has slowed, as we are working with bare essentials. The deadline for work such as submitting reports will be extended. Only emergency work will continue as it was,” an official said.The army’s complaints section for now will only be dealing with cases that are urgent. Officials said rosters had been created to divide the staff between those who work at home and those who come to the office. However, it remains to be seen what work will be given to those working from home, because files cannot be taken home due to confidentiality issues. Several issues also cannot be communicated over email due to cybersecurity threats. Moreover, JCOs and ORs are mainly clerks who are part of the filing system for letters and documents, which can be done only from the offices.Officials said training of troops had also reduced. However, this will not affect operational preparedness, because it is for a short duration and can be made up later.In relation to the unit mentioned earlier, training of troops has become more “concentrated”, because smaller batches are being trained. “This has given us an opportunity to train better. Training small groups ensures that everyone’s doubts are cleared and attention is given to each aspect. But due to the pandemic, we have to sanitise an equipment every time it is used,” an official said.This type of training comes after troops were divided into small teams that maintained a distance of 200 metre between each other. It is also being ensured that distances are being maintained between troops of a team. “Only one team can use a bathroom at a time. After the team is done, the bathroom is sanitised and only then can the other team use it. We also have separate timings for eating at the cookhouse for the teams,” the official said.A major concern for the army stations and cantonments, which are isolated areas in a city, is the civilian manpower that is coming from outside. For example, washing points and blow drying of clothes have been setup outside the gates of one of the cantonments for this manpower.","Saudi Arabia will enforce a round-the-clock nationwide curfew during the five-day Eid al-Fitr holiday later this month to fight the coronavirus, the interior ministry said Tuesday, as infections spike.

The kingdom, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in the Gulf region, is scrambling to limit the spread of the deadly disease.

A full lockdown will be reimposed around the country from May 23-27, the ministry said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. The period coincides with the Muslim festival that marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

Most parts of the kingdom were put under full lockdown following the outbreak, but last month the government relaxed the curfew between the hours of 9am and 5pm.

Malls and retailers have been allowed to reopen, except in major hotspots including the holy city of Mecca -- where confirmed cases have soared, despite a stringent lockdown.

The health ministry said Tuesday the number of COVID-19 deaths had risen to 264 and confirmed infections to 42,925, while 15,257 people have recovered.

In March, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round ""umrah"" pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading in Islam's holiest cities.

Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year's hajj -- scheduled for late July -- but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage.

Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once during their lifetime.

The Arab world's biggest economy has also closed cinemas and restaurants and halted flights as it attempts to contain the virus.

"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,"" Duque said.","Saudi Arabia will enforce a round-the-clock nationwide curfew during the five-day Eid al-Fitr holiday later this month to fight the coronavirus, the interior ministry said Tuesday, as infections spike.

"NEW DELHI: The restrictions imposed by the army on its personnel and formations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is posing challenges to its internal functioning.Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties. While this is also affecting the training routines of troops, reduction in attendance at the headquarters is set to slow down other work as well, said officials.The steps are aimed at ensuring social distancing and preventing contagion. It has created an unprecedented situation, forcing the army to improvise, especially because troops eat, sleep and train together within confined spaces. For example, one particular unit has now divided troops into teams that live in different areas, while ensuring that only one team uses the common toilets at a time. Training is conducted in small batches, and the equipment is sanitised every time it is used.The army on Monday issued fresh instructions to all its military stations, cantonments, units and formations in the 82 districts under lockdown. These include restricted movements, functioning of only those personnel engaged in essential services and the closure of all CSD canteens Officials said the reduction in manpower in some of the army’s formations was due to the extension of leave of soldiers till April 15 and placing those who recently returned on quarantine. Those who are going on leave due to an emergency in their families will be sent for a minimum period of 30 days. “We are in a situation where we are slightly less in strength. It affects day-to-day functioning, administrative and security duties. There is an increase in the workload of those on guard duties, because there is less turnover of troops,” an official said.The manpower also gets affected because troops are tasked with manning the quarantine facilities setup by the army. However, officials said the situation was not “alarming”, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army’s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept.

The Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) is privileged to have staff well trained in emergency management. During statewide and national emergencies, the DOC stands ready to respond internally to protect the health and safety of staff and the incarcerated, and externally to provide support to other state or federal agencies.

Steps Taken During COVID-19

Corrections began supporting the Department of Health (DOH) response to COVID-19 on February 9, 2020, by providing members of Corrections’ Department Incident Management Team (DIMT) to help the statewide response. The department officially opened its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at headquarters in response to COVID-19 on March 2, 2020, whose members represent every division across the agency.

While the state is under a “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order, Corrections remains open and operational as an essential business. The safety and well-being of the incarcerated, staff and public are the department’s top priorities.

Corrections has taken a number of steps to ensure the safety of those incarcerated in correctional facilities and work release, as well as those on community supervision. These steps include suspending visitation and other in-person programming to reduce outside exposure, encouraging pro-active precautions like hand-washing, extra cleaning and social distancing, and reducing the number of face-to-face contact visits community corrections officers have to make with those they supervise.

The department is also encouraging staff to stay home when sick, practice social distancing and telework wherever possible. Every staff member that needs to report in person for work receives a verbal and temperature health screening when they enter any correctional facility. The agency recently approved staff to wear expired N95 respirators (pdf). The department continues to monitor the situation to determine if additional steps are necessary as new guidance is made available.

To demonstrate the department’s commitment to openness and transparency, Corrections has posted important information on the COVID-19 Information Center, including memos, resources and decision points.

Current Protocols Followed

Corrections’ Chief Medical Officer and her team have developed protocols (pdf) that follow recommendations for isolation and quarantine set forth by DOH and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which are updated as needed to reflect the latest guidance.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 self-quarantine at home for at least 14 days. Corrections also works to identify and notify employees considered to have had close contact with a staff member with positive COVID-19 test results. Those determined to have been in close contact with the positive individual will be asked to self-quarantine at home for up to 14 days from the date of last contact with the employee who tested positive, following DOH guidelines.

If an incarcerated individual shows symptoms or tests positive, they will be isolated and treated. Those who have been in contact will be quarantined even if they are asymptomatic under the same guidelines followed under other quarantines, such as those that occur during outbreaks of the stomach flu.

Corrections Assistance in Statewide Response

In addition to the internal response, the DIMT provided logistics support to DOH along with the Washington Department of Social and Health Services and the Washington Military Department – Emergency Management Division with the statewide response to COVID-19. The support is possible because the Department of Corrections trains employees in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the national structure for emergency response enabling state and federal agencies that typically do not work together, to operate under the same structure and unified command during an emergency.

“Real world emergencies, whether it be a flood, hurricane, volcano or pandemic, provide the opportunity for our agency employees to hone their skills in emergency management and incident command,” said Emergency Operations Manager Greg Miller. “Assisting other agencies drastically increases our knowledge, skills and abilities to manage our own emergencies when they arise in the department. Above and beyond DIMT, the Department of Corrections staff statewide are always ready and willing to help out. These staff are doing great work in the offices, prisons and community during this time.”

The DIMT provided Command, Logistics and Planning staff to the Unified Command at the State Emergency Operations Center. DOC staff also provided communications support as the state stood up its Joint Information Center. Working together during an emergency allows each state agency to continue its operations, work together as a team and have a role in helping Washington to ‘flatten the curve’.

Incarcerated individuals have also expressed a desire to help. Correctional Industries (CI) workers at Coyote Ridge Corrections Center have adapted their knowledge from the textile factory to produce protective gowns to respond to the need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CI workers across the state are also working to produce additional gowns, protective masks and face shields.

“Partnerships such as this show the department’s commitment to both our mission, ‘To improve public safety by positively changing lives’ as well as our vision, ‘Working together for safer communities,’” said Secretary Steve Sinclair. “Corrections is committed to working together with other state agencies to help support the best emergency response possible, as we know our role in creating safer communities extends beyond our commitment to operating a safe and humane corrections system. We value our partnership with others as we work to transform lives for a better Washington.”",0.81137455

As a result, operating under the principle of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Galactus appoints Thor Odinson as his new Herald, transforming him with the Power Cosmic. In the Directors' Cut, Cates describes the transformation like this:

Thor rises, and he has been remade. His arm is back, as is his eye, and his hair is now LONG. Like down to his butt long. Like the nineties Thor that I love. He's also wearing a slick new costume, very sci-fi and slick. Mostly black and bright white. The white on his costume should be glowing like lightning. And the black should be made of a star field. His eyes glow as well. Crackling with energy. His hammer, a solid Mjolnir-shaped bolt of lightning. He has become cosmic-Zeus! His run sigil emblazoned on his chest. Smoke pouring off him.

This is easily the most phenomenal power-up Thor has ever received. He's never exactly been a weakling, but now he possesses all the power of the God of Thunder; wields an enchanted hammer containing a God Tempest that can destroy entire star systems; has been granted the power of the All-Father himself; and also wields the Power Cosmic, meaning he should have all the powers of any other Herald of Galactus. He's officially the strongest Avenger, the mightiest god in any of Marvel's Pantheons, and the greatest Herald ever to serve Galactus.

Donny Cates is a smart writer. That means he wouldn't have given Thor this level of power if he didn't have a story in mind that would demand it. What's more, in interviews Cates has insisted he still sees Thor as a young god, a flawed man given to fits of temper and in danger of being overcome by his own ego and pride. Galactus' prophecy - foretelling that the God of Thunder will, in fact, be the one responsible for his own destruction - suggests that Thor Odinson may well not be able to handle the vast, unfathomable powers that are now at his disposal. Will absolute power corrupt absolutely?

Deadpool 3: Marvel Villains That Could Appear","Warning: SPOILERS for Thor #1

The War of the Realms ravaged Thor's homeland, but by the end of the event, Odin the All-Father stepped down and crowned Thor as the new King of Asgard. Now, months after the end of the war, Thor has rebuilt his home. Gone are the shimmering golden palaces of his father's creation, with the seat of the king remade in wood and stone. But now what was once a golden paradise, remade into a medieval city, shaped by hammers... has just been rocked by the arrival of Galactus in Marvel's shocking Thor #1.

As Thor readies himself to give his first speech to the Asgardians gathered around their new king -- a message readers can only assume would have reflected the same message sent by the remade land itself, Galactus comes plummeting down from the sky, smashing directly into city's inhabitants, and Thor instantly realizing that scores of his people will never get the chance to hear a speech ever again.

The sight of Galactus wrapped in machine armor, decimating the crowd is a horrifying one, to be sure. Screams are heard, as bolts of lightning mark Thor's leap into the fight, prepared to kill Galactus for this invasion of his people's new home. Thankfully Thor has the presence of mind to stop before then, stopping short as Galactus pleads with Thor to understand the reason for his arrival. He has come to Asgard for help, since Thor is the only one who can stop the Great Black Winter. The newest unknown threat to Thor (and all life in the universe), and one that can only be stopped if Thor becomes the newest herald of Galactus.

Right on cue the mourning rains of Asgard begin to fall, carrying on for weeks. The city officials of Asgard work, busying themselves with counting the dead and calculating the cost of Galactus's 'arrival.' And while they may try to ignore the silence of their new king, it is evident more than just Asgard's people died the day Galactus fell. Galactus' impact also means that Yggdrasil, the tree of life, has begun to die. How will thor possibly manage to correct these tragedies, and return to his brighter vision for Asgard's future? To have those questions answered, readers will need to pick up Thor #1! Find the full details below.
