tropical storm isaac threatens dam,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

putin to win russia 's presidential election,"Carson City, NV – Today, Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford together with 22 state law enforcement partners, reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. The agreement was created to ensure donors receive adequate information and disclosures when making charitable contributions through the company’s online fundraising platform.

PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. (PPGF) is the charitable arm of PayPal, Inc. PPGF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that allows donors to contribute funds electronically to PPGF and select a charity that will ultimately receive the benefit of their contribution. Donors’ contributions are combined and distributed to the donors’ chosen charities. PPGF does not collect fees from donors or charities for this service; however, a charity receives contributions more quickly if the charity maintains a PayPal account, a fact that had not been adequately disclosed to donors. In some instances, PPGF redirected donors’ contributions from the charity selected by the donor to other organizations with similar purposes without informing donors.

“Charitable contributions are the financial backbone of many worthy causes,” said AG Ford. “Consumers should always have the information they need to make informed decisions about their donations. Today’s settlement with PayPal’s Charitable Giving Fund ensures every donor’s wishes are honored.”

Nationwide, charities regulators joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to adopt reforms to its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

—That they are contributing to PPGF;

—The timeframe in which a selected charity may receive funds from PPGF; and

—The implication of being an enrolled versus an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform.

Under the terms of the settlement, PPGF agreed to notify donors when it redirects a donor’s charitable contribution to an organization other than the one selected by the donor. PPGF will also provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

PPGF also agreed to make a payment of $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This Fund has been established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

In addition to Nevada, attorneys general from the following states and territory participated in this settlement: Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania Texas and Wisconsin.

"[Ed. – Having trouble making her mind up.]

Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state’s directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.

Michigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.

But last week, Whitmer’s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to “administrative action” should they continue to use the medication.

Gonzaga also breezed, beating Oklahoma 88-70 to join Kansas and Dayton, both of which advanced Saturday. The four top seeds won by an average of 20.5 points.

Only one Cinderella remains in the field — 10th-seeded Utah State, which won Saturday against No. 2 Florida State — but the Aggies almost got company Sunday. East Tennessee State, a 14-seed that had knocked off Seton Hall in the first round, gave BYU all it could handle before falling 100-97.

Two 7-seeds advanced Sunday as Arizona and Providence ended the dreams of UC-Irvine and North Dakota State, respectively, a pair of 15th-seeded bracket busters who had knocked out San Diego State and Kentucky on Thursday.

The Providence victory gave the Big East three teams in the Sweet 16. Five leagues have two; Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, ACC and the West Coast Conference. Rounding out the field are the SEC (Auburn), the Atlantic-10 (Dayton), and the Mountain West (Utah State).

Here’s the Day 4 roundup of games:

SOUTH REGIONAL

No. 1 Baylor 87, No. 8 Saint Mary’s 56>> The Gaels’ season came to an agonizingly slow end. They fell behind early, trailed by 18 at half and by 33 with 11:44 to play. It was their worst loss since a 94-46 embarrassment at Gonzaga in February 2019. Butler (28-4) was led in scoring, as it has been all season, by its trio of guards. Davion Mitchell 20 points), MaCio Teague (17) and Jared Butler (15), none of whom had shot better than 42% during the regular season, all shot better than 50%.

Jordan Ford, wrapping up a four-year career that could put his No. 3 in the rafters at Saint Mary’s, scored 24 points, but nobody else was in double figures. Malik Fitts, who made seven 3-pointers in the first-round victory over Rutgers, had only seven points. The Gaels (27-9) shot poorly from everywhere: 3 of 16 from behind the arc, nine of 15 from the free throw line, and 36.7% overall. (We did not attempt to reach coach Randy Bennett after this one.)

No. 6 Virginia 63, No. 3 Michigan State 59>> The Cavaliers, who run-and-gunned their way to a season-high 82 points in the opening round (25 points over their season average) returned to character. With its slow-paced offense and smothering defense, Virginia held MSU to 25 first-half points, limiting the Spartans to 19 shots, seven of which they blocked, and forcing seven turnovers. Still, the Spartans had a chance to tie the game with 11 seconds left, but Rocket Watts missed a wide-open three from the corner and Virginia sealed the outcome with two free throws from Jay Huff. Mamadi Diakite had 21 points and eight rebounds for the UVA (25-7) and Braxton Key added 13 points and 13 rebounds. MSU (23-10) was led by three players with 11 points, including Xavier Tillman, who also had 11 rebounds.

No. 2 Creighton 76, No. 7 Illinois 69 >>- The Bluejays, the only surviving 2-seed in the tournament, trailed by 11 points in the second half and were down 65-59 with 4:16 to play. But they closed the game on a 17-4 run during which they held Illinois scoreless on eight consecutive possessions. Denzel Mahoney came off the bench for 17 points to lead Creighton (26-7). Damien Jefferson had 15 and Ty-Shon Alexander and Marcus Zegarowski added 12 apiece. Kofi Cockburn had 16 points and 10 rebounds to lead Illinois (22-10).

WEST REGIONAL

No. 1 Gonzaga 88, No. 9 Oklahoma 70>> Cory Kispert led six players in double figures and the Zags broke open a close game midway through the second half. An 8-2 run — the first six points coming from Joel Ayayi –turned a 50-45 lead into an 11-point lead and the Sooners never got back within 10. Kispert had 17 points, Filip Petrusev had 12, and four others had 11, including Ayayi. Austin Reaves scored 17 to lead Oklahoma (20-13).

No. 6 BYU 100, No. 14 Eastern Washington 97>> Zac Seljaas’ 3-point shot from the right wing broke a 93-93 tie with 1:37 to play, Andy Toolson followed with another three and the Cougars escaped the upset-minded Eagles from the Big Sky Conference. BYU made 13 of 22 three-point attempts (59.1%) and shot almost 60% overall (40 of 67) and then held its collective breath as a last-second shot by EWU circled the rim twice before spinning out. TJ Haws (26 points, 12 assists) and Yoeli Childs (26 points, 11 rebounds) led the way for BYU. Jacob Davison had 29 points for EWU (24-9).

No. 7 Arizona 89, No. 15 UC-Irvine 66>> Zeke Nnaji had 18 points and 17 rebounds as the Wildcats put an early end to the Anteaters’ hope of pulling another upset. UC-Irvine, which shocked No. 2 seed San Diego State on Friday, led 17-16 after a 3-pointer by Jeron Artest (son of Ron Artest). But Arizona answered with a bucket and two free throws from Max Hazzard (grandson of the late Walt Hazzard) and the Wildcats led the rest of the way. Tony Rutherford had 15 points for UCI (22-11). Arizona’s Nico Mannion led all scorers with 19.

MIDWEST REGIONAL

No. 3 Duke 98, No. 14 East Tennessee State 89>> The upstarts from the Southern Conference, who had stunned Seton Hall in the opener, jumped out to a 7-1 lead. And that’s where Duke put a stop to things. The Blue Devils caught the Eagles at 16, passed them on a tip-in by Javin DuLaurier and never trailed after a 10-0 run put them ahead 49-39. ETU, winners of 13 straight, pulled within 78-75, but then went cold for almost six minutes as Duke rebuilt its lead to 13 and coasted into Sweet 16 for the 16th time in 20 years. Vernon Carey led the Blue Devils with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Tre Jones, playing amid rumors that he will apply for the NBA draft, had 16 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Cassius Stanley also had 16 points. Patrick Good had 22 for ETU, which finished the season 31-4.

No. 7 Providence 104, No. 15 North Dakota State 57>> The Friars jumped on the team that had KO’d Kentucky two days earlier, scoring the first seven points en route to a 20-5 lead. Providence led 51-33 at halftime and didn’t let up, outscoring the Bison 53-24 in the second half. Luwane Pipkins led six Friars in double figures with 19 points, hitting 5 of 7 treys. Alpha Diallo added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Rocky Kreuser had 16 to lead North Dakota State (26-9), which had won 13 of its previous 14 games.",0.65922874

i think it is depends on the program .,"Carson City, NV – Today, Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford together with 22 state law enforcement partners, reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. The agreement was created to ensure donors receive adequate information and disclosures when making charitable contributions through the company’s online fundraising platform.

PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. (PPGF) is the charitable arm of PayPal, Inc. PPGF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that allows donors to contribute funds electronically to PPGF and select a charity that will ultimately receive the benefit of their contribution. Donors’ contributions are combined and distributed to the donors’ chosen charities. PPGF does not collect fees from donors or charities for this service; however, a charity receives contributions more quickly if the charity maintains a PayPal account, a fact that had not been adequately disclosed to donors. In some instances, PPGF redirected donors’ contributions from the charity selected by the donor to other organizations with similar purposes without informing donors.

“Charitable contributions are the financial backbone of many worthy causes,” said AG Ford. “Consumers should always have the information they need to make informed decisions about their donations. Today’s settlement with PayPal’s Charitable Giving Fund ensures every donor’s wishes are honored.”

Nationwide, charities regulators joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to adopt reforms to its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

—That they are contributing to PPGF;

—The timeframe in which a selected charity may receive funds from PPGF; and

—The implication of being an enrolled versus an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform.

Under the terms of the settlement, PPGF agreed to notify donors when it redirects a donor’s charitable contribution to an organization other than the one selected by the donor. PPGF will also provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

PPGF also agreed to make a payment of $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This Fund has been established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

In addition to Nevada, attorneys general from the following states and territory participated in this settlement: Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania Texas and Wisconsin.

there are a few things i think you should do .,"Women need to use various facial and beauty products to take good care of their skin. These products are not just limited to women, but are also essential for every man out there. Men are also vain in many ways. They want to look their best on all occasions by having a nice haircut, sporting a clean beard, and having pearly white teeth. Men have every right to look attractive to the opposite sex, and they also deserve to age gracefully.

Investing in your physical appearance is always a significant advantage in everything that you do. Looking good will increase your chances of getting promoted for your dream job, it increases your self-esteem, and it makes it easier for you to meet the girl of your dreams. So if you are looking for hygiene products, here are the things that you should stock up on for your bathroom cabinet.

Beard products

If you are sporting a beard, it is essential to keep it clean and dry at all times. Aside from applying shampoo and conditioner, it would help if you also used a few drops of essential oils and special balm to help moisturise the skin and the entire beard. Combing it once or twice a day will help get rid of all the dirt that has been stuck in it. You may want to check out the products from online stores like https://missionbeard.com for all your beard-related needs.

Hair conditioner

Regardless of if you are sporting a clean-cut or long hair, using a hair conditioner should be included in your hygiene product list. Some shampoos tend to dry your hair and scalp; that is why applying some conditioner will help you replenish lost nutrients. With continuous use, it will also make your hair smoother and stronger. Besides, having dry hair makes you prone to split ends which is something that you do not want to have.

Sunscreen

Too much sun exposure can lead to premature skin ageing and wrinkles. It is a must to use a sunscreen for your face and body to keep it protected all day. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher to prevent getting sunburned. Remember that UV rays are harmful to the skin and cause certain types of skin cancer.

Lip balm

Extreme weather changes can cause your lips to become dry and chaffed. Even men should use a lip balm to keep their lips moisturised. Choose a product that is light, non-greasy and long-lasting on the lips. If you do not feel like using lip balm, you can use petroleum jelly.

Lotion

There are a lot of factors that can cause your skin to become dry and dull. Using a moisturising body cream can help improve your skin by making it soft and supple. For best results, you should apply lotion after taking a bath and before going to bed.

Lastly, do not forget to apply toner and moisturiser on your face as part of your nightly skincare routine. These products will help your skin look fresher.

Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state’s directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.

Michigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.

But last week, Whitmer’s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to “administrative action” should they continue to use the medication.

The storm destroyed a good portion of the outfield fence, took down four, 80-foot light towers, and ripped the roofs off of both dugouts.","Carson City, NV – Today, Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford together with 22 state law enforcement partners, reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. The agreement was created to ensure donors receive adequate information and disclosures when making charitable contributions through the company’s online fundraising platform.

PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. (PPGF) is the charitable arm of PayPal, Inc. PPGF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that allows donors to contribute funds electronically to PPGF and select a charity that will ultimately receive the benefit of their contribution. Donors’ contributions are combined and distributed to the donors’ chosen charities. PPGF does not collect fees from donors or charities for this service; however, a charity receives contributions more quickly if the charity maintains a PayPal account, a fact that had not been adequately disclosed to donors. In some instances, PPGF redirected donors’ contributions from the charity selected by the donor to other organizations with similar purposes without informing donors.

“Charitable contributions are the financial backbone of many worthy causes,” said AG Ford. “Consumers should always have the information they need to make informed decisions about their donations. Today’s settlement with PayPal’s Charitable Giving Fund ensures every donor’s wishes are honored.”

Nationwide, charities regulators joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to adopt reforms to its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

—That they are contributing to PPGF;

—The timeframe in which a selected charity may receive funds from PPGF; and

—The implication of being an enrolled versus an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform.

Under the terms of the settlement, PPGF agreed to notify donors when it redirects a donor’s charitable contribution to an organization other than the one selected by the donor. PPGF will also provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

PPGF also agreed to make a payment of $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This Fund has been established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

In addition to Nevada, attorneys general from the following states and territory participated in this settlement: Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania Texas and Wisconsin.
