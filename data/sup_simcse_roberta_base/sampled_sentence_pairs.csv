There is no dog riding a skateboard,"The annual budget presented by



Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday proposed creation of a world-class aquarium in Mumbai, which would be a part of an international standard tourism complex.

In December last year, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed the officials of the Tourism Department to chalk out a plan to build a world-class aquarium in Mumbai.

""An international standard tourism complex would come up on the Worli Dairy land with an estimated cost of Rs 1,000 crore. An international standard aquarium will be built there,"" Pawar said while presenting his budget in the Legislative Assembly.

Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, presented the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government's maiden budget in the Lower House.

He announced an outlay of Rs 1,400 crore for the Department of Tourism. Aaditya Thackeray, son of the chief minister, is the state Tourism and Minister.

Pawar also announced creation of a special fund to combat global warming and climate change, the issues over which Aaditya Thackeray has time and again expressed concerns.

Pawar said several pilgrimage spots in the state, including Mahurgad in Nanded district, Parli Vaijanath, Aundha Nagnath, Narsi Namdev in Hingoli district, ancient Shiva temple in Ambarnath and Hazrat Khwaja Shamna Mira Dargah in Miraj, would be developed.

For the development of popular tourist destinations, such as Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani Rs 100 crore have been set aside in the budget.

The government also set aside Rs 55 crore for the diamond jubilee celebrations of the state, which was formed on May 1, 1960.

Besides, Rs 25 crore have been allocated for the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.

The budget also increased the MLA fund from Rs 2 crore (declared in 2011) to Rs 3 crore. Pawar said the move is aimed at enabling the elected representatives to spend more in their constituencies.

Two women are wearing bikinis on the beach which is sandy,"NEW YORK >> In a world suffering a pandemic, cash is no longer king.

A growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over their useful life, could be a vector for the spreading coronavirus.

Public officials and health experts have said that the risk of transferring the virus person-to-person through the use of banknotes is small. But that has not stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency and some countries from urging their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

Open Books, a non-profit bookstore in Chicago, sent an email to customers last week asking individuals not to use cash. A chain of diners in Washington State has also stopped accepting cash. And delivery services like Grubhub, Door Dash, and others have instituted “no contact” deliveries, and have either stopped offering cash as a payment option or are actively discouraging it.

Experts say cash does carry a risk of transmitting the virus, but the risk from cash so far is small compared with other transmission routes. A scientific paper published early in the outbreak found the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers, however, did not test whether it can live on banknote paper.

The presence of live virus particles on banknotes does not mean they are a health hazard, public health experts said. Virus particles are unlikely to return to the air, or aerosolize, once on a surface.

“It’s not impossible that there might be traces of virus on dollar bills but if you wash your hands it should provide adequate protections, you shouldn’t need anything else,” said Julie Fischer, a professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Society at Georgetown University, on C-SPAN.

Other devices used to pay for items are just as likely to be vectors for disease transfer. Credit and debit cards are made of plastic and metal. ATMs are touched by hundreds of human hands a day. And there have been studies that show smartphones are heavily contaminated with bacteria because of their constant use.

Even the Federal Reserve has taken efforts to make sure the money supply is not contaminated. Banknotes that circulated in Europe and Asia are being quarantined for seven to 10 days as a “precautionary measure,” according to a Federal Reserve spokesperson.

While businesses are discouraging cash usage, there have been reports of customers making large withdrawals from ATMs in several parts of the country. Some banks have had to order additional cash from the Fed or keep ATMs stocked at higher levels to allow larger customer withdrawals.

Banknote avoidance is not just happening in the U.S. In South Korea, which has been more successful in stemming the outbreak, the country’s central bank took all banknotes out of circulation for two weeks or, in some cases, burned paper money.

Iran is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in the Middle East. Using cash there is common, but in recent weeks many people have avoided it and banks have announced that they will not accept cash from customers. Iranians often have multiple debit cards but cash is widely used in small-scale transactions, like buying bread in bakeries or leaving a tip. Many people have started even being careful in how they hand over debit cards, as contactless payment methods haven’t caught on there.",0.6396039

"Police suspect an international criminal gang has been trafficking people from mainland Europe to Britain via Finland.

A gang suspected of smuggling people from mainland Europe to Britain was uncovered in January when a Swedish citizen and a Kuwaiti citizen were stopped by border guards at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in possession of another Swedish citizen’s passport.

The two men were on their way from Paris to London via Helsinki, according to a statement issued by the Finnish Border Guard.

The Guard’s Crime Prevention Unit launched a preliminary investigation, and discovered that the Swedish man had visited Finland on at least two previous occasions. He is now suspected of smuggling two other people from Finland to Britain between December and January using other people's passports.

Police suspect the involvement of a people smuggling ring active in at least Sweden and the United Kingdom.

They believe the smugglers charge up to 8,000 euros per person transported from mainland Europe through various countries to the United Kingdom.

The initial investigation also revealed that the Swedish citizen stopped in Finland had applied for asylum in the United Kingdom as a Kuwaiti, providing false personal information to the UK authorities.

The false identity used by the suspect in Britain was revealed when his fingerprints were compared to the fingerprints of another Kuwaiti person, and they were found to be exactly the same. Authorities suspect the man created a false identity for himself in order to gain access to a disguise for people smuggling activities.

International cooperation

During the investigation, close international cooperation was established between Finnish authorities and police forces in other parts of Europe, with the support of Europol and Eurojust, an EU agency which oversees judicial cooperation between member states.

Authorities in both Sweden and Britain conducted home searches of suspected members of the smuggling ring and made a number of arrests.",taiwan 's economy grows 2.27 % in april-june quarter,0.6815291

protest against us drone strikes in pak postponed,"The U.K. has added to international pressure on China to answer questions over information it gave the world about the coronavirus outbreak but said the priority now is to beat the pandemic.

Asked on Monday if China needed to explain how quickly it made the world aware of the extent of the virus, the U.K.'s defense minister said: ""I think it does.""

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

""Only by being open and transparent will we learn about it, and China needs to be open and transparent about what it learned, and its shortcomings, but also its successes,"" Wallace said.

His comments come after a barrage of U.S. criticism against China regarding its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accusations that it was not transparent when it came to making the world aware.

President Donald Trump has increasingly blamed China, and he repeated that accusation on Sunday, saying he believed that a ""mistake"" in China was the cause of the pandemic, though he did not present any evidence for the claim.

Speaking during a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump said, ""I think they made a horrible mistake and didn't want to admit it.""",0.76301867

Two kids are taking out a green colored crocodile float from a swimming pool,"NEW YORK >> In a world suffering a pandemic, cash is no longer king.

A growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over their useful life, could be a vector for the spreading coronavirus.

Public officials and health experts have said that the risk of transferring the virus person-to-person through the use of banknotes is small. But that has not stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency and some countries from urging their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

Open Books, a non-profit bookstore in Chicago, sent an email to customers last week asking individuals not to use cash. A chain of diners in Washington State has also stopped accepting cash. And delivery services like Grubhub, Door Dash, and others have instituted “no contact” deliveries, and have either stopped offering cash as a payment option or are actively discouraging it.

Experts say cash does carry a risk of transmitting the virus, but the risk from cash so far is small compared with other transmission routes. A scientific paper published early in the outbreak found the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers, however, did not test whether it can live on banknote paper.

The presence of live virus particles on banknotes does not mean they are a health hazard, public health experts said. Virus particles are unlikely to return to the air, or aerosolize, once on a surface.

“It’s not impossible that there might be traces of virus on dollar bills but if you wash your hands it should provide adequate protections, you shouldn’t need anything else,” said Julie Fischer, a professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Society at Georgetown University, on C-SPAN.

Other devices used to pay for items are just as likely to be vectors for disease transfer. Credit and debit cards are made of plastic and metal. ATMs are touched by hundreds of human hands a day. And there have been studies that show smartphones are heavily contaminated with bacteria because of their constant use.

Even the Federal Reserve has taken efforts to make sure the money supply is not contaminated. Banknotes that circulated in Europe and Asia are being quarantined for seven to 10 days as a “precautionary measure,” according to a Federal Reserve spokesperson.

While businesses are discouraging cash usage, there have been reports of customers making large withdrawals from ATMs in several parts of the country. Some banks have had to order additional cash from the Fed or keep ATMs stocked at higher levels to allow larger customer withdrawals.

Banknote avoidance is not just happening in the U.S. In South Korea, which has been more successful in stemming the outbreak, the country’s central bank took all banknotes out of circulation for two weeks or, in some cases, burned paper money.

Iran is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in the Middle East. Using cash there is common, but in recent weeks many people have avoided it and banks have announced that they will not accept cash from customers. Iranians often have multiple debit cards but cash is widely used in small-scale transactions, like buying bread in bakeries or leaving a tip. Many people have started even being careful in how they hand over debit cards, as contactless payment methods haven’t caught on there.",0.76892376

Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday proposed creation of a world-class aquarium in Mumbai, which would be a part of an international standard tourism complex.

In December last year, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed the officials of the Tourism Department to chalk out a plan to build a world-class aquarium in Mumbai.

""An international standard tourism complex would come up on the Worli Dairy land with an estimated cost of Rs 1,000 crore. An international standard aquarium will be built there,"" Pawar said while presenting his budget in the Legislative Assembly.

Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, presented the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government's maiden budget in the Lower House.

He announced an outlay of Rs 1,400 crore for the Department of Tourism. Aaditya Thackeray, son of the chief minister, is the state Tourism and Minister.

Pawar also announced creation of a special fund to combat global warming and climate change, the issues over which Aaditya Thackeray has time and again expressed concerns.

Pawar said several pilgrimage spots in the state, including Mahurgad in Nanded district, Parli Vaijanath, Aundha Nagnath, Narsi Namdev in Hingoli district, ancient Shiva temple in Ambarnath and Hazrat Khwaja Shamna Mira Dargah in Miraj, would be developed.

For the development of popular tourist destinations, such as Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani Rs 100 crore have been set aside in the budget.

The government also set aside Rs 55 crore for the diamond jubilee celebrations of the state, which was formed on May 1, 1960.

Besides, Rs 25 crore have been allocated for the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.

The budget also increased the MLA fund from Rs 2 crore (declared in 2011) to Rs 3 crore. Pawar said the move is aimed at enabling the elected representatives to spend more in their constituencies.

""But I think the time for the post-mortem on this is after we've all got it under control and have come through it and our economies are back to normal,"" U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace told LBC Radio.

The power structure that now dominates the globe is a logical extension of the project for colonizing Africa, Oceania, and the Americas that the European imperialist powers began over five centuries ago. From the start of this project, it's been a constant rule for those in the colonizing powers that one's society is at war with a weaker enemy. The indigenous people, who have been portrayed as not capable of running things, have had to be brought under the colonial boot according to the ideology of imperial conquest. And in accordance with the global rise of capitalism that colonialism precipitated, the same dynamic of subjugation has existed between the poor and the rich.

Throughout their efforts to defeat their enemies, the imperialist powers of the last millennium and the empires that came before them have constantly been fighting against adversaries that can't be totally subdued, even after they've been greatly weakened by slavery and mass extermination. The ethnic and religious groups that have been subjugated by imperialism have virtually all been able to survive, and have continued their cultures and their collective will to find self-determination. So they've constantly posed a challenge to the power of imperialism even as imperialism has ruled supreme, much like the existence of the proletariat has constantly put the rule of the bourgeoisie into question. The same tension has ultimately existed during every other unjust hierarchy.

To maintain their control over this constant threat from the oppressed, the ruling class in the age of imperialism has used unprecedentedly powerful tools of warfare against groups which have stood in their way. Covert CIA operations alone are estimated to have killed at least six million people. The U.S. has used vast bombing campaigns, starvation sanctions, and most recently drone warfare to kill tens of millions of people since World War II. These methods of genocide have been replicated to great extents by Israel during its war against the Palestinians, and by Saudi Arabia during its war against the Yemenis. This all is added onto the millions of deaths that occur annually because of the poverty that's sustained by global capitalism, and to the frequent killings of poor people by the ever-deadlier police states throughout the capitalist world.

Despite these methods of warfare, imperialism and corporate power continue to be challenged. American hegemony is declining amid frayings of alliances among the NATO powers, failures from the U.S. to carry out its foreign policy goals in countries like Syria, and the rise of Chinese influence. Massive protests have broken out in neoliberal Third World countries like Chile and Honduras, and worker struggles are intensifying in places like France. Those in the global underclass are fighting as hard as ever, and in places like the DPRK and Venezuela they've already gained dominance through proletarian democracy. A power struggle is still in motion.

It's in motion because of the contradictions of capitalism, which have become heightened during the era of capitalist imperialism. By subjecting entire nations to invasions, severe poverty, and apartheid, imperialism makes the oppressive dynamics of capitalism so pronounced that revolts from the colonized people become inevitable. Added onto the conflict between bourgeoisie and proletariat that's inherent to all capitalist societies, this self-destructive aspect of imperialism has led to vast decolonization movements and successful socialist revolutions throughout the last century.

As the U.S. empire weakens, this liberation movement is naturally gathering strength. The recent resurgence of Third World revolutionary energy is present even in Bolivia, where strong socialist and indigenous strains threaten to overtake the fascist regime that's been installed in the country. But there's still a way that the bourgeoisie can remain dominant in an era after the fall of the U.S. empire, and even in an era after the climate has collapsed.

This transition can be accomplished by making the means for wielding political and social power-such as steady access to electricity, the ability to use weaponry, and reliable nourishment and shelter-available only to the rich. In the developed world, capitalism has sustained itself by letting most of the population share in the technological and economic gains that the system creates, however unequally they're distributed. The United States and most other core imperialist nations have never experienced a socialist revolution because conditions for the broad masses haven't deteriorated enough to provoke an effective class uprising. Many bourgeois leaders have deliberately tried to maintain this balance by allowing the welfare state to be expanded, which has deterred the proletariat from pursuing revolution. But faced with the collapse of the climate, the ruling class has overwhelmingly decided to keep making society ever more unequal instead of reducing inequality.

Even in more progressive capitalist countries like Iceland, the prevailing decision within the political establishment has been to continue neoliberalism and not try to alleviate the wealth gap. Austerity has increased throughout almost the entire capitalist world since the 2008 financial crisis, wages have kept falling, and the power of the big banks and corporations is greater than ever. And the collapse of the climate hasn't driven capitalist governments to resist corporate power, it's caused there to be more privatization of services and more capitalist efforts to profit from crises. 2005's Hurricane Katrina and 2017's Hurricane Irma both caused there to be a wave of privatizations in the impacted areas, and the U.S. army and private military contractors used both disasters to increase the militarization of society.

A recurring part of these responses to climate change has been an effort to more clearly define boundaries between the wealthy areas and the poorer areas. The lines between the wealthy areas (called the green zones) and the poor areas (called the red zones) was how the U.S. decided to distribute resources in Iraq during its post-invasion efforts to reconstruct the country. The green zone/red zone dichotomy, despite not usually being defined with such explicit language, is being increasingly applied to how resources are distributed around the globe. The homes and neighborhoods of the rich are protected from the threats of climate change-like was the case during 2018's California fires-while poor communities are the ones that suffer.

There's a political purpose behind this environmentally created inequality, one that's understood by the billionaires who've prepared for a later stage of the climate crisis by creating luxury survival compounds for themselves. It's to deprive those outside the wealthy enclaves of the resources that they'll need to survive, or at least to live with modern comforts, as the climate deteriorates. The logical conclusion of climate apartheid, as this 21st century class divide has been called, is a new kind of despotism that's emerging while capitalism collapses. In a world that's no longer climatically stable, and where resources have become scarce, the capitalist class will only be able to maintain their status and lifestyle by concentrating wealth at the very top. In other words, by replacing capitalism with a nakedly oppressive system that has virtually no social mobility.

Now that capitalism has reached the long-anticipated point where it consumes too much of nature to be able to sustain itself, the elites are creating a new system which is much more centralized and tightly controlled than the one that preceded it. Since the Industrial Revolution, bourgeois societies have typically been liberal, with freedom of expression usually being legal and the proletariat being able to heavily consume and make a living when the economy was doing well. But now democracy is deteriorating around the capitalist world, and the neoliberal economies are in a perpetual state of decline that makes economic participation harder for the proletariat.

Whereas capitalist markets overall grew massively in the 20th century, in the 21st century they've been shrinking. Trade and economic growth are slowing down, and the post-recession economic expansion has been dependent on financial bubbles and beneficial mainly for those in the upper strata. In the U.S., unemployment and underemployment still haven't recovered from their pre-recession levels, and the global economy becomes more unequal every year. The next financial crash will create a situation far worse, one that's exacerbated by the decline of the dollar and by the irreversible economic damage of climate change.

All of these destabilizing factors within capitalist markets are naturally causing capitalist political systems to become less free, and capitalist economies to be more controlled by the state and its partnered corporate monopolies. Economic and climatic disruptions have caused a global rise in reactionary politics and a subsequent decline in democracy throughout much of the capitalist world. And the 2008 crash has caused the U.S. government to transfer many trillions of dollars to the biggest banks, enabling these private financial institutions to become larger than ever.

Similar trends will follow as the collapse of capitalism continues. Power, both political and economic, will become consolidated as the system eats itself. The capitalist class will remain capitalists in the traditional sense only when they're profiting in some way from the world's disasters, or when they manage to profit from the labor of the few proletarians who manage to get jobs within the isolated societies of the rich. Otherwise they won't exploit the proletariat nearly to the extent that they used to, because society won't even be functional enough for labor and commerce to be robust. Most of the people in the world will be driven into poverty, become climate refugees, or simply die off, leaving the bourgeoisie with no choice but to shrink their business operations and retreat to their green zones.

In such a situation, the ruling class will still be the dominant group, and they could expand their power in new areas. They could pursue capitalist development in eventually hospitable places like Greenland and Antarctica, they could colonize Mars, and they could even build cities that float on the ocean. But they'll still need to stop the world's underclass from overthrowing them, which will be harder than ever after the climate and economy have collapsed. Whether the bourgeoisie can retain its dominance amid the riots, vast influxes of refugees, and massive organized rebellions will depend on whether the bourgeoisie or the proletariat gain the upper hand over political and military power.

disruptions : u.s. agency warns of java software problem,"NEW YORK >> In a world suffering a pandemic, cash is no longer king.

A growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over their useful life, could be a vector for the spreading coronavirus.

Public officials and health experts have said that the risk of transferring the virus person-to-person through the use of banknotes is small. But that has not stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency and some countries from urging their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

Open Books, a non-profit bookstore in Chicago, sent an email to customers last week asking individuals not to use cash. A chain of diners in Washington State has also stopped accepting cash. And delivery services like Grubhub, Door Dash, and others have instituted “no contact” deliveries, and have either stopped offering cash as a payment option or are actively discouraging it.

Experts say cash does carry a risk of transmitting the virus, but the risk from cash so far is small compared with other transmission routes. A scientific paper published early in the outbreak found the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers, however, did not test whether it can live on banknote paper.

The presence of live virus particles on banknotes does not mean they are a health hazard, public health experts said. Virus particles are unlikely to return to the air, or aerosolize, once on a surface.

“It’s not impossible that there might be traces of virus on dollar bills but if you wash your hands it should provide adequate protections, you shouldn’t need anything else,” said Julie Fischer, a professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Society at Georgetown University, on C-SPAN.

Other devices used to pay for items are just as likely to be vectors for disease transfer. Credit and debit cards are made of plastic and metal. ATMs are touched by hundreds of human hands a day. And there have been studies that show smartphones are heavily contaminated with bacteria because of their constant use.

Even the Federal Reserve has taken efforts to make sure the money supply is not contaminated. Banknotes that circulated in Europe and Asia are being quarantined for seven to 10 days as a “precautionary measure,” according to a Federal Reserve spokesperson.

While businesses are discouraging cash usage, there have been reports of customers making large withdrawals from ATMs in several parts of the country. Some banks have had to order additional cash from the Fed or keep ATMs stocked at higher levels to allow larger customer withdrawals.

Banknote avoidance is not just happening in the U.S. In South Korea, which has been more successful in stemming the outbreak, the country’s central bank took all banknotes out of circulation for two weeks or, in some cases, burned paper money.

Iran is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in the Middle East. Using cash there is common, but in recent weeks many people have avoided it and banks have announced that they will not accept cash from customers. Iranians often have multiple debit cards but cash is widely used in small-scale transactions, like buying bread in bakeries or leaving a tip. Many people have started even being careful in how they hand over debit cards, as contactless payment methods haven’t caught on there.",0.7984494

A seven-year-old was among a handful of youngsters found carrying knives at school but could not be charged because they were below the age of criminal responsibility.

Figures from Kent Police, obtained by the PA news agency, show 109 children were investigated for possessing, or threatening with, an offensive weapon or blade - or attempting to - in Kent from April 2017 to December 2019.

The law says children aged under 10 cannot currently be charged with a crime.

Two children, aged seven and nine, were prevented from being prosecuted for a knife-related offence because of their age, while a 10-year-old was also let off for the same reason, meaning he or she was likely suspected of committing an offence while still below the age of criminal responsibility.

(Image: Mirror)

Data showed the most common age for suspects was 14 (23 incidents), while 13-year-olds were involved in 21 incidents, and 15-year-olds were suspected of 20 offences.

Five adults, aged 45, 35, 31, 19 and 18, were also investigated for having knives on school premises.

Three of them, the 35-year-old and the two teenagers, were later charged with an offence.

In total, 116 incidents were recorded by Kent Police during the two-and-a-half-year time frame.

All but three of them involved a knife.

There were 15 community resolutions, where police deal with low-level offences without resorting to formal criminal justice sanctions.

Seven cases resulted in a youth caution, while ""evidential difficulties"" put an end to a potential prosecution in dozens of cases.

On other occasions, the incident was either passed on to another body to deal with away from the courts, or a prosecution was deemed not to be in the public interest.

The release of data by Kent Police follows similar disclosures by the majority of forces in England and Wales under FoI laws earlier in the year.

A PA investigation in October found thousands of children had been caught carrying weapons in school, with suspects as young as four years old.

Police seized scores of knives, blades and other sharp instruments, while a 14-year-old was found in possession of a sword.

The total figure for England and Wales was expected to be much higher, considering a number of forces, including the Metropolitan Police, the largest in the country, did not provide data.e.",osama bin laden wives to be jailed,0.8031733

"EASTENDERS star Jake Wood has poked fun at his Love Island lookalike Ollie Williams.

Fans have been floored by the millionaire's resemblance to the soap Lothario ever since he was announced to be going into the villa earlier this week.

Now the Max Branning actor has acknowledged his doppelganger - and was unable to resist a cheeky jibe about the 23-year-old heir's wealth.

Taking to his Instagram page, 47-year-old Jake shared a popular meme that has been circling social media in recent days.

In the image, the Love Island promotional shot of topless Ollie is twinned with a picture of Jake dressed as suave businessman Max in Albert Square.

Above the pictures it is written: ""Good to see Max from EastEnders going into the villa! #LoveIsland"".

Jake captioned the meme: ""FYI I’m the one on the right who doesn’t own a beach in Cornwall"" alongside two crying with laughter emojis.

The post comes after Ollie told The Sun Online that he could miss out on his £15million inheritance if he has sex on TV.

The blonde hunk's family run the Lanhydrock Estate in Cornwall, and has been warned by his dad to behave himself or face the consequences.

He told us: ""Dad said he would write me out of the will. I said to him, ‘OK, brilliant’.

""Mum was like, ‘Oh my God’.""

"Mar. 19–Scroll through the gallery above to see images of the San Francisco Bay Area that’s under a shelter-in-place order to prevent COVID-19 spread.

March 19, 9:45 a.m. UC San Francisco announced Thursday it’s working to increase COVID-19 testing capacity in coming weeks.

Since March 9, UCSF Health has been testing about 60 to 100 inpatients a day with a test using “a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique” that’s similar to the one administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“PCR allows scientists to detect very small amounts of virus in a sample obtained with a swab from a patient’s nose and throat,” UCSF said in a statement. “The technique depends on the availability of special substances known as reagents (“ree-AY-gents”), which are in very short supply nationwide, as are the swabs used to obtain patient samples. UCSF is making every effort to ensure we have a robust and reliable supply chain for all the materials we need to maintain and expand our testing capacity.”

UCSF is expanding its laboratory and as long as the medical center has access to testing reagents, it is on track to increase testing capacity to as many as 1,000 inpatients and symptomatic outpatients per day over the next few weeks.

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and CZ Biohub are helping support the effort.

March 19, 7:30 a.m. Three residents of the Atria Burlingame assisted living facility in San Mateo tested positive for COVID-19, according to ABC 7. The facility is now closed to visitors and the three residents are all hospitalized. KRON 4 reports that two additional residents are under hospital quarantine. San Mateo County Health Department and CDC are investigating the situation.

Atria Burlingame wasn’t immediately available for comment on this story.

Fans have been floored by the millionaire's resemblance to the soap Lothario ever since he was announced to be going into the villa earlier this week.

Now the Max Branning actor has acknowledged his doppelganger - and was unable to resist a cheeky jibe about the 23-year-old heir's wealth.

Taking to his Instagram page, 47-year-old Jake shared a popular meme that has been circling social media in recent days.

In the image, the Love Island promotional shot of topless Ollie is twinned with a picture of Jake dressed as suave businessman Max in Albert Square.

Above the pictures it is written: ""Good to see Max from EastEnders going into the villa! #LoveIsland"".

Jake captioned the meme: ""FYI I’m the one on the right who doesn’t own a beach in Cornwall"" alongside two crying with laughter emojis.

The post comes after Ollie told The Sun Online that he could miss out on his £15million inheritance if he has sex on TV.

The blonde hunk's family run the Lanhydrock Estate in Cornwall, and has been warned by his dad to behave himself or face the consequences.

He told us: ""Dad said he would write me out of the will. I said to him, ‘OK, brilliant’.

"Mar. 19–Scroll through the gallery above to see images of the San Francisco Bay Area that’s under a shelter-in-place order to prevent COVID-19 spread.

March 19, 9:45 a.m. UC San Francisco announced Thursday it’s working to increase COVID-19 testing capacity in coming weeks.

Since March 9, UCSF Health has been testing about 60 to 100 inpatients a day with a test using “a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique” that’s similar to the one administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“PCR allows scientists to detect very small amounts of virus in a sample obtained with a swab from a patient’s nose and throat,” UCSF said in a statement. “The technique depends on the availability of special substances known as reagents (“ree-AY-gents”), which are in very short supply nationwide, as are the swabs used to obtain patient samples. UCSF is making every effort to ensure we have a robust and reliable supply chain for all the materials we need to maintain and expand our testing capacity.”

UCSF is expanding its laboratory and as long as the medical center has access to testing reagents, it is on track to increase testing capacity to as many as 1,000 inpatients and symptomatic outpatients per day over the next few weeks.

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and CZ Biohub are helping support the effort.

March 19, 7:30 a.m. Three residents of the Atria Burlingame assisted living facility in San Mateo tested positive for COVID-19, according to ABC 7. The facility is now closed to visitors and the three residents are all hospitalized. KRON 4 reports that two additional residents are under hospital quarantine. San Mateo County Health Department and CDC are investigating the situation.

Atria Burlingame wasn’t immediately available for comment on this story.

Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.","NEW YORK >> In a world suffering a pandemic, cash is no longer king.

A growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over their useful life, could be a vector for the spreading coronavirus.

Public officials and health experts have said that the risk of transferring the virus person-to-person through the use of banknotes is small. But that has not stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency and some countries from urging their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

Open Books, a non-profit bookstore in Chicago, sent an email to customers last week asking individuals not to use cash. A chain of diners in Washington State has also stopped accepting cash. And delivery services like Grubhub, Door Dash, and others have instituted “no contact” deliveries, and have either stopped offering cash as a payment option or are actively discouraging it.

Experts say cash does carry a risk of transmitting the virus, but the risk from cash so far is small compared with other transmission routes. A scientific paper published early in the outbreak found the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers, however, did not test whether it can live on banknote paper.

The presence of live virus particles on banknotes does not mean they are a health hazard, public health experts said. Virus particles are unlikely to return to the air, or aerosolize, once on a surface.

“It’s not impossible that there might be traces of virus on dollar bills but if you wash your hands it should provide adequate protections, you shouldn’t need anything else,” said Julie Fischer, a professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Society at Georgetown University, on C-SPAN.

Other devices used to pay for items are just as likely to be vectors for disease transfer. Credit and debit cards are made of plastic and metal. ATMs are touched by hundreds of human hands a day. And there have been studies that show smartphones are heavily contaminated with bacteria because of their constant use.

Even the Federal Reserve has taken efforts to make sure the money supply is not contaminated. Banknotes that circulated in Europe and Asia are being quarantined for seven to 10 days as a “precautionary measure,” according to a Federal Reserve spokesperson.

While businesses are discouraging cash usage, there have been reports of customers making large withdrawals from ATMs in several parts of the country. Some banks have had to order additional cash from the Fed or keep ATMs stocked at higher levels to allow larger customer withdrawals.

Banknote avoidance is not just happening in the U.S. In South Korea, which has been more successful in stemming the outbreak, the country’s central bank took all banknotes out of circulation for two weeks or, in some cases, burned paper money.

Iran is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in the Middle East. Using cash there is common, but in recent weeks many people have avoided it and banks have announced that they will not accept cash from customers. Iranians often have multiple debit cards but cash is widely used in small-scale transactions, like buying bread in bakeries or leaving a tip. Many people have started even being careful in how they hand over debit cards, as contactless payment methods haven’t caught on there.",0.929424

Members of an international criminal group, smuggling people from mainland Europe to the United Kingdom, had been intercepted at Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport, the Finnish Border Guard said on Thursday.

The human traffickers were identified when a Swedish citizen and a Kuwaiti, who had used another person’s Swedish passport, were arrested at the airport in January.

The two men were on their way from Paris via Helsinki to London, the Border Guard said.

According to a preliminary investigation launched by the Crime Prevention Unit of the Gulf of Finland Coast Guard District, it was not the Swedish man’s first such journey to Finland.

Between December 2019 and January 2020, he is suspected to have smuggled two other foreigners from Finland to the UK by using other people’s passports.

The investigation has also found that the Swedish citizen caught in Finland had applied for asylum in the UK as a Kuwaiti by providing false personal information to the local authorities.

The criminal offences under investigation in Finland are part of a series of operations, in which people have been smuggled from mainland Europe through various countries to the UK, the Border Guard said.

The acts are suspected to have been carried out by an influential professional smuggling ring in Sweden and the UK.

The criminal gang is suspected of having charged the trafficked persons around 8,000 euros ($8,600) for each trip.

During the investigation, close international cooperation was established with the support of Europol (the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) and Eurojust (a European Union agency dealing with judicial cooperation in criminal matters).

Members of the smuggling ring have been caught in both Sweden and the UK, where local authorities conducted home searches and arrests.

A suspect in Finland, the Swedish citizen has been imprisoned since the end of January 2020 on suspicion of organising a serious illegal entry.

The investigation into the other members of the criminal ring continues in Finland and abroad, the Border Guard said.

A gang suspected of smuggling people from mainland Europe to Britain was uncovered in January when a Swedish citizen and a Kuwaiti citizen were stopped by border guards at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in possession of another Swedish citizen’s passport.

The two men were on their way from Paris to London via Helsinki, according to a statement issued by the Finnish Border Guard.

The Guard’s Crime Prevention Unit launched a preliminary investigation, and discovered that the Swedish man had visited Finland on at least two previous occasions. He is now suspected of smuggling two other people from Finland to Britain between December and January using other people's passports.

Police suspect the involvement of a people smuggling ring active in at least Sweden and the United Kingdom.

They believe the smugglers charge up to 8,000 euros per person transported from mainland Europe through various countries to the United Kingdom.

The initial investigation also revealed that the Swedish citizen stopped in Finland had applied for asylum in the United Kingdom as a Kuwaiti, providing false personal information to the UK authorities.

The false identity used by the suspect in Britain was revealed when his fingerprints were compared to the fingerprints of another Kuwaiti person, and they were found to be exactly the same. Authorities suspect the man created a false identity for himself in order to gain access to a disguise for people smuggling activities.

International cooperation

During the investigation, close international cooperation was established between Finnish authorities and police forces in other parts of Europe, with the support of Europol and Eurojust, an EU agency which oversees judicial cooperation between member states.

Authorities in both Sweden and Britain conducted home searches of suspected members of the smuggling ring and made a number of arrests.",0.9905635
