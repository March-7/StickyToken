You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

完整contract_texts: ['assad says syria will comply with un arms resolution', 'COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund (PPGF), requiring the organization to boost transparency for donors on its online fundraising platform.\n\n“Mixing secrecy with charity hardens the hearts of would-be donors,” Yost said. “This promise of transparency means donors will now have the information they need to guide their giving.”\n\nUsers of the platform pay money electronically to PPGF, which aggregates the donations and distributes them to charities selected by each donor. But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.\n\nCharity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:\n\nThat they are contributing to PPGF\n\nThe timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF\n\nThe implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform\n\nPPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.\n\nStates and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.\n\nSubmitted by the office of Attorney General Dave Yost.', 'dotson was arrested monday in his native maryland and charged with murder .', 'serve as a reason or cause or justification of .', 'But he has continued to anger opponents with some of his comments, in 2020 telling talkRadio\'s Julia Hartley-Brewer he would only "take the knee" - go down on bended knee - for "the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me".']
